"Words are pegs to hang ideas on."
- Henry Ward Beecher, in "Proverbs from Plymouth Pulpit" in The Human Mind (1887).

"A very great part of the mischiefs that vex this world arises from words."
- Edmund Burke, letter (c. 1795)."

"When I use a word", Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less". "The question is", said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things". "The question is", said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master—that's all".
- Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass (1934; first published in 1872), chapter 6, p. 205.

Words do not express thoughts very well. They always become a little different immediately after they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom to one man seems nonsense to another.
Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha (1922).
(error handling?)

What do you read, my lord?
Words, words, words.
William Shakespeare, Hamlet (1600-02), Act II, scene 2, line 193.

The idiot heard the sounds, but they had no meaning for him. He lived inside somewhere, apart, and the little link between word and significance hung broken.

Language is the picture and counterpart of thought.
Mark Hopkins, Address, Dedication of Williston Seminary, Dec. 1, 1841.

Language is the dress of thought.
Samuel Johnson, Lives of the English Poets (1781), "The Life of Cowley".

Anyone who invents a language,” he said, “finds that it requires a suitable habitation and a history in which it can develop. A real language is never invented, of course. It is a natural thing. It is wrong to call the language you grow up speaking your native language. It is not. It is your first learnt language. It is a by-product of the total make-up of the animal.
J.R.R. Tolkien [2]

Verbing weirds language.
Bill Watterson, Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat: A Calvin and Hobbes Collection (1994), p. 53.

The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
Ludwig Wittgenstein Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (5.6)

## Grammar

Ill-fitting grammar are like ill-fitting shoes. You can get used to it for a bit, but then one day your toes fall off and you can't walk to the bathroom.
Jasper Fforde in: One of our Thursdays is Missing: Thursday Next, Book 6, Hachette UK, 22 February 2011, p. 23.

Grammar, which knows how to control even kings.
Molière in Les Femmes Sevantes (1672) in Act II, sc. vi., in:Corneille et son temps: étude littéraire, Didier, 1858, p. 96 and in: Les Femmes Sevantes (1672) in Act II, sc. vi. Quoted in: James Gosling The Java Language Specification, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2000, p. 90.

To be serious, I write good grammar myself, but not in that spirit, I am thankful to say. That is to say, my grammar is of a high order, though not at the top. Nobody's is. Perfect grammar—persistent, continuous, sustained—is the fourth dimension, so to speak many have sought it, but none has found it.
Mark Twain in Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1: The Complete and Authoritative Edition, University of California Press, 15-Nov-2010, p. 120.

## Names

Ah! replied my gentle fair,
Beloved, what are names but air?
Choose thou whatever suits the line:
Call me Sappho, call me Chloris,
Call me Lalage, or Doris,
Only, only, call me thine.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, What's in a Name.

A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.
Proverbs, XXII. 1.

## Objects

Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.
Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, ix. 9.

## Trees

A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
William Blake, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790–1793).

"Mister!" he said with a sawdusty sneeze.
"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.
I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.
And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs"
Dr. Seuss, The Lorax (1971)

This is the forest primeval.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie (1847), Introduction.

When the sappy boughs
Attire themselves with blooms, sweet rudiments
Of future harvest.
John Phillips, Cider, Book II, line 437.

Of harmes two the less is for to chose.

## Logic

Logic: The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding.
Ambrose Bierce (1911), The Devil's Dictionary

No, no, you're not thinking; you're just being logical.
Attributed to Niels Bohr in: William Glen (1994) The Mass-Extinction Debates: How Science Works in a Crisis. p. 62

"Contrariwise," continued Tweedledee, "if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."
Lewis Carroll (1871), Through the Looking-Glass, Chapter 4

Logic, like whiskey, loses its beneficial effect when taken in too large quantities.
Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Lord Dunsany (1878–1957), "Weeds & Moss", My Ireland

It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. To know how to criticize is good, to know how to create is better.
Henri Poincaré, Science and Method (1908) Part II. Ch. 2 : Mathematical Definitions and Education, p. 129

“Love is many things none of them logical.”
― William Goldman, The Princess Bride

A lot of the time I get obsessed by little nerdy things in my corner that no one else is interested in. I have that nerd factor in my character.
Bjork

There are those who love to get dirty and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn, beer after work. And those who stay clean, just appreciate things. At breakfast they have milk and juice at night. There are those who do both, they drink tea. Gary Snyder

I usually get up not before 9. I have a huge library - I'm a big fan of Scandinavian crime fiction - so I'll usually take a book and go off to one of my favorite bistros for a cappuccino or espresso or maybe I'll have some lovely smoked salmon for breakfast. Anthony Geary

Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. Lewis Carroll

Breakfast is a notoriously difficult meal to serve with a flourish. Clement Freud

Big stuff and little: learning how to order breakfast in a country where I don't speak the language and haven't been before - that's really satisfying to me. I like that. Anthony Bourdain

What nicer thing can you do for somebody than make them breakfast? Anthony Bourdain

All my life, my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name.
Andre Breton

How great are the dangers I face to win a good name in Athens.
Alexander the Great
