When we first talk about compiling Lox, explain that "compiling" doesn't always
mean "statically typed". See:

One way to look at compilation is that it separates out the behavior of a
program into two halves. The static stuff is the same no matter how the code
executes. The dynamic stuff is only known at runtime. A compiler then does all
the static work once, before the code is run.

See chapter 6 of Lisp in Small Pieces.
