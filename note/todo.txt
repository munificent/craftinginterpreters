- Somewhere, explain what "dynamic" and "static" mean. The former is at runtime,
  and the latter is before runtime.

- Consider adding a challenge in jlox's control flow chapter to add goto? See:
  https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/7nxidv/how_to_implement_goto_statements_in_a_programming/ds5fyx2/

- Old style numbers in running text (but not in headings).

- Write a script to measure my "writing tics" and see if the style is consistent
  over time. Measure:

  - Frequency of most common words.
  - Frequency of my bad habits: "just", "a bit", "a little", "let's", "can",
    "need to", etc.
  - Sentence length.
  - Paragraph length.
  - Frequency of contractions.
  - Number of asides.
  - Number of illustrations.

- Remove "not done" script, templates and styles.

- Replace "work in progress" header with something about print edition.

- Fix jlox NaN test failures.

- Add snippets for remaining chapters to compile_snippets to pin down which
  snippets reach a working point.

- Fix the extra paragraph tags on the aside images in "Classes and Instances"
  and "Closures".
