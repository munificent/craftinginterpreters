- Somewhere, explain what "dynamic" and "static" mean. The former is at runtime,
  and the latter is before runtime.

- Consider adding a challenge in jlox's control flow chapter to add goto? See:

- Old style numbers in running text (but not in headings).

- Write a script to measure my "writing tics" and see if the style is consistent
  over time. Measure:

  - Frequency of most common words.
  - Frequency of my bad habits: "just", "a bit", "a little", "let's", "can",
    "need to", etc.
  - Sentence length.
  - Paragraph length.
  - Frequency of contractions.
  - Number of asides.
  - Number of illustrations.

- Remove "not done" script, templates and styles.

- Replace "work in progress" header with something about print edition.

- Update snippet in introduction to match new generated output.
