Can you believe it? We've reached the last chapter of [Part II][]. We're almost
done with our first Lox interpreter. The [previous chapter][] was a big ball of
intertwined object-orientation features. I couldn't separate those from each
other, but I did manage to untangle one piece. In this chapter, we'll finish
off Lox's class support by adding **inheritance.**

Inheritance appears in object-oriented languages all the way back to the <span
name="inherited">first</span> one, [Simula][]. Early on, Kristen Nygaard and
Ole-Johan Dahl noticed commonalities across classes in the simulation programs
they wrote. Inheritance gave them a way to reuse the code for those similar
parts.

You could say all those other languages *inherited* it from Simula. Hey-ooo!
I'll, uh, see myself out.

## Superclasses and Subclasses

Given that the concept is "inheritance", you would hope they would pick a
consistent metaphor and call them "parent" and "child" classes, but that would
be too easy. Way back when, C.A.R. Hoare coined the term "<span
name="subclass">subclass</span>" to refer to a record type that refines another
type. Simula borrowed that term to refer to a *class* that inherits from
another. I don't think it was until Smalltalk came along that someone flipped
the Latin prefix to get "superclass" to refer to the other side of the
relationship. From C++, you also hear "base" and "derived" classes. I'll mostly
stick with "superclass" and "subclass".

<aside name="subclass">

"Super-" and "sub-" mean "above" and "below" in Latin, respectively. Picture an
inheritance tree with the root at the top like a family tree -- subclasses are
below their superclasses on the diagram. More generally, "sub-" refers to things
that refine or are contained by some more general concept. In zoology, a
subclass is a finer categorization of a larger class of living things.

In set theory, a subset is contained by a larger superset which has all of the
elements of the subset and possibly more. Set theory and programming languages
directly collide in type theory. There, you have "supertypes" and "subtypes".

In statically-typed object-oriented languages, a subclass is also often a
subtype of its superclass. Say we have a Doughnut superclass and a BostonCream
subclass. Every BostonCream is also an instance of Doughnut, but there may be
doughnut objects that are not BostonCreams (like crullers).

Think of a type as the set of all values of that type. The set of all Doughnut
instances contains the set of all BostonCream instances since every BostonCream
is also a Doughnut. So BostonCream is a subclass, and a subtype, and its
instances are a subset. It all lines up.

![Boston cream <: doughnut.](image/inheritance/doughnuts.png)

</aside>

Our first step towards supporting inheritance in Lox is a way to specify a
superclass when declaring a class. There's a lot of variety in syntax for this.
C++ and C# place a `:` after the subclass's name, followed by the superclass
name. Java uses `extends` instead of the colon. Python puts the superclass(es)
in parentheses after the class name. Simula puts the superclass's name *before*
the `class` keyword.

This late in the game, I'd rather not add a new reserved word or token to the
lexer. We don't have `extends` or even `:`, so we'll follow Ruby and use `<`:

```lox
class Doughnut {
  // General doughnut stuff...
}

class BostonCream < Doughnut {
  // Boston Cream-specific stuff...
}
```

To work this into the grammar, we add a new optional clause in our existing
`classDecl` rule:

```lox
classDecl â†’ "class" IDENTIFIER ( "<" IDENTIFIER )?
            "{" function* "}" ;
```

After the class name, you can have a `<` followed by the superclass's name. The
superclass clause is optional because you don't *have* to have a superclass.
Unlike some other object-oriented languages like Java, Lox has no root "Object"
class that everything inherits from, so when you omit the superclass clause, the
class has *no* superclass, not even an implicit one.

We want to capture this new syntax in the class declaration's AST node:

^code superclass-ast (1 before, 1 after)

You might be surprised that we store the superclass name as an Expr.Variable,
not a Token. The grammar restricts the superclass clause to a single identifier,
but at runtime, that identifier is evaluated as a variable access. Wrapping the
name in an Expr.Variable early on in the parser gives us an object that the
resolver can hang the resolution information off of.

The new parser code follows the grammar directly:

^code parse-superclass (1 before, 1 after)

Once we've (possibly) parsed a superclass declaration, we store it in the AST:

^code construct-class-ast (2 before, 1 after)

If we didn't parse a superclass clause, the superclass expression will be
`null`. We'll have to make sure the later passes check for that. The first of
those is the resolver:

^code resolve-superclass (1 before, 2 after)

The class declaration AST node has a new subexpression, so we traverse into and
<span name="self">resolve</span> that. Since classes are usually declared at the
top level, the superclass name will most likely be a global variable, so this
doesn't usually do anything useful. However, Lox allows class declarations even
inside blocks, so it's possible the superclass name refers to a local variable.
In that case, we need to make sure it's resolved.

Because even well-intentioned programmers sometimes write weird code, there's a
silly edge case we need to worry about while we're in here. Take a look at:

```lox
class Oops < Oops {}
```

There's no way this will do anything useful and if we let it go until the
runtime, it will break the expectation the interpreter has about there not being
cycles in the inheritance chain. The safest thing is to detect it statically and
report it as an error:

^code inherit-self (2 before, 1 after)

Assuming the code resolves without error, it travels to the interpreter:

^code interpret-superclass (1 before, 1 after)

If the class has a superclass expression, we evaluate it. Since that could
potentially evaluate to some other kind of object, we have to check at runtime
that the thing you want to be the superclass is actually a class. Bad things
would happen if we allowed code like:

```lox
var NotAClass = "I am totally not a class";

class Subclass < NotAClass {} // ?!
```

Assuming that check passes, we continue on. Executing a class declaration turns
the syntactic representation of a class -- its AST node -- into its runtime
representation, a LoxClass object. We need to plumb the superclass through to
that too. We pass it through the constructor:

^code interpreter-construct-class (3 before, 1 after)

...which stores it:

^code lox-class-constructor (1 after)

...in a new field:

^code lox-class-superclass-field (1 before, 1 after)

That's our foundation -- the syntax and runtime representation the semantics
will build on. We can define classes that are subclasses of other classes. Now,
what does having a superclass actually *do?*

## Inheriting Methods

Inheriting from another class means that everything that's <span
name="liskov">true</span> of the superclass should be true, more or less, of the
subclass. In statically-typed languages that carries a lot of implications. The
sub-*class* must also be a sub-*type* and the memory layout is controlled so
that you can pass an instance of a subclass to a function expecting a superclass
and it can still access the inherited fields correctly.

<aside name="liskov">

A fancier name for this hand-wavey guideline is the [*Liskov substitution
principle*][liskov]. Barbara Liskov introduced it in a keynote during the
formative period of object-oriented programming.

[liskov]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle

</aside>

Lox is a dynamically-typed language, so our requirements are much simpler.
Basically, it means that if you can call some method on an instance of the
superclass, you should be able to call that method when given an instance of the
subclass. In other words, methods are inherited from the superclass.

This lines up with one of the goals of inheritance -- to give users a way to
reuse code across classes. Implementing this in our interpreter is
astonishingly easy:

^code find-method-recurse-superclass (3 before, 1 after)

That's literally all there is to it. When we are looking up a method on an
instance, if we don't find it on the instance's class, we recurse up through the
superclass chain and look there. Give it a try:

```lox
class Doughnut {
  cook() {
    print "Fry until golden brown.";
  }
}

class BostonCream < Doughnut {}

BostonCream().cook();
```

There we go, half of our inheritance features are complete with only three lines
of Java code.

## Calling Superclass Methods

In `findMethod()` we look for a method on the current class *before* walking up
the superclass chain. If a method with the same name exists in both the subclass
and the superclass, the subclass one takes precedence or **overrides** the
superclass method. Sort of like how variables in inner scopes shadow outer ones.

That's great if the subclass wants to *replace* some superclass behavior
completely. But, in practice, subclasses often want to *refine* the superclass's
behavior. They want to do a little work specific to the subclass, but also
execute the original superclass behavior too.

However, since the subclass has overridden the method, there's no way to refer
to the original one. If the subclass method tries to call it by name, it will
just recursively hit its own override. We need a way to say "Call this method,
but look for it directly on my superclass and ignore my override". Java uses
`super` for this, and we'll use that same syntax in Lox:

```lox
class Doughnut {
  cook() {
    print "Fry until golden brown.";
  }
}

class BostonCream < Doughnut {
  cook() {
    super.cook();
    print "Pipe full of custard and coat with chocolate.";
  }
}

BostonCream().cook();
// Prints:
// Fry until golden brown.
// Pipe full of custard and coat with chocolate.
```

The `super` keyword, followed by a dot and an identifier looks for a method with
that name. Unlike calls on `this`, the search starts at the superclass.

### Syntax

With `this`, the keyword works sort of like a magic variable and the expression
is that one lone token. But with `super`, the subsequent `.` and property name
are inseparable parts of the super expression. You can't have a bare `super`
token all by itself:

```lox
print super; // Syntax error.
```

So the new clause we add to the `primary` rule in our grammar includes the
property access as well:

```lox
primary â†’ "true" | "false" | "nil" | "this"
        | NUMBER | STRING | IDENTIFIER | "(" expression ")"
        | "super" "." IDENTIFIER ;
```

Typically, a super expression is used for a method call, but, as with regular
methods, the argument list is *not* part of the expression. Instead, a super
*call* is a super *access* followed by a function call. Like other method calls,
you can get a handle to a superclass method and invoke it separately:

```lox
var method = super.cook;
method();
```

So the super expression itself contains only the token for the `super` keyword
and the name of the method being looked up. The corresponding <span
name="super-ast">syntax tree node</span> is thus:

^code super-expr (1 before, 1 after)

<aside name="super-ast">

The generated code for the new node is in [Appendix II][appendix-super].

[appendix-super]: appendix-ii.html#super-expression

</aside>

Following the grammar, the new parsing code goes inside our existing `primary()`
method:

^code parse-super (2 before, 2 after)

A leading `super` keyword tells us we've hit a super expression. After that we
consume the expected `.` and method name.

### Semantics

Earlier, I said a super expression starts the method lookup from "the
superclass", but *which* superclass? I need to be more precise. The naÃ¯ve answer
is the superclass of `this`, the object the surrounding method was called on.
That coincidentally produces the right behavior in a lot of cases, but that's
not actually correct. Gaze upon:

```lox
class A {
  method() {
    print "A method";
  }
}

class B < A {
  method() {
    print "B method";
  }

  test() {
    super.method();
  }
}

class C < B {}

C().test();
```

Translate this program to Java, C#, or C++ and it would print "A method", which
is what we want Lox to do too. When this program runs, inside the body of
`test()`, `this` is an instance of C. The superclass of C is B, but that is
*not* where the lookup should start. If it did, we would hit B's `method()`.

Instead, lookup should start on the superclass of *the class containing the
super expression*. In this case, since `test()` is defined inside B, the super
expression inside it should start the lookup on *B*&rsquo;s superclass -- A.

<span name="flow"></span>

<img src="image/inheritance/classes.png" alt="The call chain flowing through the classes." />

<aside name="flow">

The execution flow looks something like this

1. We call `test()` on an instance of C.

2. That enters the `test()` method inherited from B. That calls
   `super.method()`.

3. The superclass of B is A, so that chains to `method()` on A, and the program
   prints "A method".

</aside>

Thus, in order to evaluate a super expression, we need access to the superclass
of the class definition surrounding the call. Alack and alas, at the point in
the interpreter where we are executing a super expression, we don't have that
easily available.

We *could* add a field to LoxFunction to store a reference to the LoxClass that
owns that method. The interpreter would keep a reference to the
currently-executing LoxFunction so that we could look it up later when we hit a
super expression. From there, we'd get the LoxClass of the method, then its
superclass.

That's a lot of plumbing. In the [last chapter][], we had a similar problem when
we needed to add support for `this`. In that case, we used our existing
environment and closure mechanism to store a reference to the current object.
Could we do something similar for storing the superclass<span
name="rhetorical">?</span> Well, I probably wouldn't be talking about it if the
answer was "no", so... yes.

<aside name="rhetorical">

Does anyone even like rhetorical questions?

</aside>

[last chapter]: classes.html

One important difference is that we bound `this` when the method was *accessed*.
The same method can be called on different instances and each needs its own
`this`. With super expressions, the superclass is a fixed property of the *class
declaration itself*. Every time you evaluate some super expression, the
superclass is always the same.

That means we can create the environment for the superclass once, when the class
definition is executed. Immediately before we define the methods, we make a new
environment to bind the class's superclass to the name `super`:

<img src="image/inheritance/superclass.png" alt="The superclass environment." />

When we create the LoxFunction runtime representation for each method, that is
the environment they will capture in their closure. Later, when a method is
invoked and `this` is bound, the superclass environment becomes the parent for
the method's environment, like so:

<img src="image/inheritance/environments.png" alt="The environment chain including the superclass environment." />

That's a lot of machinery, but we'll get through it a step at a time. Before we
can get to creating the environment at runtime, we need to handle the
corresponding scope chain in the resolver:

^code begin-super-scope (2 before, 2 after)

If the class declaration has a superclass, then we create a new scope
surrounding all of its methods. In that scope, we define the name "super". Once
we're done resolving the class's methods, we discard that scope:

^code end-super-scope (2 before, 1 after)

It's a minor optimization, but we only create the superclass environment if the
class actually *has* a superclass. There's no point creating it when there isn't
a superclass since there'd be no superclass to store in it anyway.

With "super" defined in a scope chain, we are able to resolve the super
expression itself:

^code resolve-super-expr

We resolve the `super` token exactly as if it were a variable. That stores the
number of hops along the environment chain the interpreter needs to walk to find
the environment where the superclass is stored.

This code is mirrored in the interpreter. When we evaluate a subclass
definition, we create a new environment:

^code begin-superclass-environment (6 before, 2 after)

Inside that environment, we store a reference to the superclass -- the actual
LoxClass object for the superclass which we have now that we are in the runtime.
Then we create the LoxFunctions for each method. Those will capture the current
environment -- the one where we just bound "super" -- as their closure, holding
onto the superclass like we need. Once that's done, we pop the environment:

^code end-superclass-environment (2 before, 2 after)

We're ready to interpret super expressions themselves. There's a few moving
parts, so we'll build this method up in pieces:

^code interpreter-visit-super

First, the work we've been leading up to. We look up the surrounding class's
superclass by looking up "super" in the proper environment.

When we access a method, we also need to bind `this` to the object the method is
accessed from. In an expression like `doughnut.cook`, the object is whatever we
get from evaluating `doughnut`. In a super expression like `super.cook`, the
current object is implicitly the *same* current object that we're using. In
other words, `this`. Even though we are looking up the *method* on the
superclass, the *instance* is still `this`.

Unfortunately, inside the super expression, we don't have a convenient node for
the resolver to hang the number of hops to `this` on. Fortunately, we do control
the layout of the environment chains. The environment where "this" is bound is
always right inside the environment where we store "super":

^code super-find-this (2 before, 1 after)

Offsetting the distance by one looks up "this" in that inner environment. I
admit this isn't the most <span name="elegant">elegant</span> code, but it
works.

<aside name="elegant">

Writing a book that includes every single line of code for a program means I
can't hide the hacks and cut corners by leaving them as an "exercise for the
reader".

</aside>

Now we're ready to look up and bind the method, starting at the superclass:

^code super-find-method (2 before, 1 after)

This is almost exactly like the code for looking up a method of a get
expression, except that we call `findMethod()` on the superclass instead of on
the class of the current object.

That's basically it. Except, of course, that we might *fail* to find the method.
So we check for that too:

^code super-no-method (2 before, 2 after)

There you have it! Take that BostonCream example earlier and give it a try.
Assuming you and I did everything right, it should fry it first, then stuff it
with cream.

### Invalid uses of super

As with previous language features, our implementation does the right thing when
the user writes correct code, but we haven't bulletproofed the intepreter
against bad code. In particular, consider:

```lox
class Eclair {
  cook() {
    super.cook();
    print "Pipe full of crÃ¨me pÃ¢tissiÃ¨re.";
  }
}
```

This class has a super expression, but no superclass. At runtime, the code for
evaluating super expressions assumes that "super" was successfully resolved and
will be found in the environment. That's going to fail here because there is no
surrounding environment for the superclass since there is no superclass. The JVM
will throw an exception and bring our interpreter to its knees.

Heck, there are even simpler broken uses of super:

```lox
super.notEvenInAClass();
```

We could handle errors like these at runtime by checking to see if the look-up
of "super" succeeded. But we can tell statically -- just by looking at the
source code -- that Eclair has no superclass and thus no super expression will
work inside it. Likewise, in the second example, we know that the super
expression is not even inside a method body.

Even though Lox is dynamically typed, that doesn't mean we want to defer
*everything* to runtime. If the user made a mistake, we'd like to help them find
it sooner rather than later. So we'll report these errors statically, in the
resolver.

First, we add a new case to the enum we use to keep track of what kind of class
is surrounding the current code being visited:

^code class-type-subclass (1 before, 1 after)

We'll use that to distinguish when we're inside a class that has a superclass
versus one that doesn't. When we resolve a class declaration, we set that if the
class is a subclass:

^code set-current-subclass (1 before, 1 after)

Then, when we resolve a super expression, we check to see that we are currently
inside a scope where that's allowed:

^code invalid-super (1 before, 1 after)

If not -- oopsie! -- the user made a mistake.

## Conclusion

We made it! That final bit of error-handling is the last chunk of code needed to
complete our Java implementation of Lox. This is a real <span
name="superhero">accomplishment</span> and one you should be proud of. In the
past dozen chapters and a thousand or so lines of code, we have learned and
implemented...

## Challenges

1.  Lox only supports *single inheritance* -- a class may have a single
    superclass and that's the only way to reuse methods across classes. Other
    languages have explored a variety of ways to more freely reuse and share
    capabilities across classes: mixins, traits, multiple inheritance, virtual
    inheritance, extension methods, etc.

    If you were to add some feature along these lines to Lox, which would you
    pick and why? If you're feeling courageous (and you should be at this
    point), go ahead and add it.

1.  In Lox, as in most other object-oriented languages, when looking up a
    method, we start at the bottom of the class hierarchy and work our way up --
    a subclass's method is preferred over a superclass's. In order to get to the
    superclass method from within an overriding method, you use `super`.

    The language [BETA][] takes the [opposite approach][inner]. When you call a
    method, it starts at the *top* of the class hierarchy and works *down*. A
    superclass method wins over a subclass method. In order to get to the
    subclass method, the superclass method can call `inner`, which is sort of
    like the inverse of `super`. It chains to the next method down the
    hierarchy.

    The superclass method controls when and where the subclass is allowed to
    refine its behavior. If the superclass method doesn't call `inner` at all,
    then the subclass has no way of overriding or modifying the superclass's
    behavior.

    Take out Lox's current overriding and `super` behavior and replace it with
    BETA's semantics. In short:

    * When calling a method on a class, prefer the method *highest* on the
      class's inheritance chain.

    * Inside the body of a method, a call to `inner` looks for a method with the
      same name in the nearest subclass along the inheritance chain between the
      class containing the `inner` and the class of `this`. If there is no
      matching method, the `inner` call does nothing.

    For example:

        :::lox
        class Doughnut {
          cook() {
            print "Fry until golden brown.";
            inner();
            print "Place in a nice box.";
          }
        }

        class BostonCream < Doughnut {
          cook() {
            print "Pipe full of custard and coat with chocolate.";
          }
        }

        BostonCream().cook();

    This should print:

        :::text
        Fry until golden brown.
        Pipe full of custard and coat with chocolate.
        Place in a nice box.

1.  In the chapter where I introduced Lox, [I challenged you][challenge] to
    come up with a couple of features you think the language is missing. Now
    that you know how to build an interpreter, implement one of those features.
