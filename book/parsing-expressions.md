<span name="parse">This</span> chapter marks the first major milestone of the
book. Many of us have cobbled together a mishmash of regular expressions and
substring operations to extract some sense out of a pile of text. The code was
probably riddled with bugs and a beast to maintain. Writing a *real* parser --
one with decent error-handling, a coherent internal structure, and the ability
to robustly chew through a sophisticated syntax -- is considered a rare,
impressive skill. In this chapter, you will <span name="attain">attain</span>
it.

<aside name="parse">

"Parse" comes to English from the Old French "pars" for "part of speech". It
means to take a text and map each word to the grammar of the language. We use it
here in the same sense, except that our language is a little more modern than
Old French.

<aside name="attain">

Like many rites of passage, you'll probably find it looks a little smaller, a
little less daunting when it's behind you than when it loomed ahead.

</aside>

It's easier than you think, partially because we front-loaded a lot of the hard
work in the [last chapter][]. You already know your way around a formal grammar.
You're familiar with syntax trees, and we have some Java classes to represent
them. The only remaining piece is parsing -- transmogrifying a sequence of
tokens into one of those syntax trees.

[last chapter]: representing-code.html

Some CS textbooks make a big deal out of parsers. In the 60s, computer
scientists -- reasonably fed up with programming in assembly language -- started
designing more sophisticated, <span name="human">human</span>-friendly languages
like FORTRAN and ALGOL. Alas, they weren't very *machine*-friendly, for the
primitive machines at the time.

<aside name="human">

Consider how harrowing assembly programming on those old machines must have been
for *FORTRAN* to be an improvement.

</aside>

They designed languages that they honestly weren't even sure how to write
compilers for, and then did ground-breaking work inventing parsing and compiling
techniques that could handle these new big languages on those old tiny machines.

Classic compiler books read like fawning hagiographies of these pioneers and
their tools. The cover of "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools"
literally has a dragon labeled "complexity of compiler design" being slain by a
knight bearing a sword and shield branded "LALR parser generator" and "syntax
directed translation". They laid it on thick.

A little self-congratulation is well-deserved, but the truth is you don't need
to know most of that stuff to bang out a high quality parser for a modern
machine. As always, I encourage you to broaden your education and take it in
later, but this book omits the trophy case.

## Ambiguity and the Parsing Game

In the last chapter, I said you can "play" a context free grammar like a game in
order to *generate* strings. Now, we play that game in reverse. Given a
string -- a series of tokens -- we map those tokens to terminals in the grammar
to figure out which rules could have generated that string.

The "could have" part is interesting. It's entirely possible to create a grammar
that is *ambiguous*, where different choices of productions can lead to the same
string. When you're using the grammar to *generate* strings, that doesn't matter
much. Once you have the string, who cares how you got to it?

When parsing, ambiguity means the parser may misunderstand the user's code.
Here's the Lox expression grammar we put together in the last chapter:

```lox
expression → literal
           | unary
           | binary
           | grouping ;

literal    → NUMBER | STRING | "false" | "true" | "nil" ;
grouping   → "(" expression ")" ;
unary      → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary     → expression operator expression ;
operator   → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
           | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
```

This is a valid string in that grammar:

<img src="image/parsing-expressions/tokens.png" alt="6 / 3 - 1" />

But there are two ways we could have generated it. One way is:

1. Starting at `expression`, pick `binary`.
2. For the left-hand `expression`, pick `NUMBER`, and use `6`.
3. For the operator, pick `"/"`.
4. For the right-hand `expression`, pick `binary` again.
5. In that nested `binary` expression, pick `3 - 1`.

Another is:

1. Starting at `expression`, pick `binary`.
2. For the left-hand `expression`, pick `binary` again.
3. In that nested `binary` expression, pick `6 / 3`.
4. Back at the outer `binary`, for the operator, pick `"-"`.
4. For the right-hand `expression`, pick `NUMBER`, and use `1`.

Those produce the same *strings*, but not the same *syntax trees*:

<img src="image/parsing-expressions/syntax-trees.png" alt="Two valid syntax trees: (6 / 3) - 1 and 6 / (3 - 1)" />

In other words, the grammar allows seeing the expression as `(6 / 3) - 1` or `6
/ (3 - 1)`. That in turn affects the result of evaluating it. The way
mathematicians have solved this ambiguity since blackboards were first invented
is by defining rules for precedence and associativity.

*   <span name="nonassociative">**Precedence**</span> determines which operator
    is evaluated first in an expression containing a mixture of different
    operators. Precedence rules tell us that we evaluate the `/` before the `-`
    in the above example. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated
    before operators with lower precedence. Equivalently, higher precedence
    operators are said to "bind tighter".

*   **Associativity** determines which operator is evaluated first in a series
    of the *same* operator. When an operator is **left-associative** (think
    "left-to-right"), operators on the left evaluate before those on the right.
    Since `-` is left-associative, this expression:

        :::lox
        5 - 3 - 1

    is equivalent to:

        :::lox
        (5 - 3) - 1

    Assignment, on the other hand, is **right-associative**. This:

        :::lox
        a = b = c

    is equivalent to:

        :::lox
        a = (b = c)

<aside name="nonassociative">

While not common these days, some languages specify that certain pairs of
operators have *no* relative precedence. That makes it a syntax error to mix
those operators in an expression without using explicit grouping.

Likewise, some operators are **non-associative**. That means it's an error to
use that operator more than once in a sequence. For example, Perl's range
operator isn't associative, so `a .. b` is OK, but `a .. b .. c` is an error.

</aside>

Without well-defined precedence and associativity, an expression that uses
multiple operators is ambiguous -- it can be parsed into different syntax trees,
which could in turn evaluate to different results. For Lox, we follow the same
precedence rules as C, going from highest to lowest:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <td>Name</td>
  <td>Operators</td>
  <td>Associates</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Unary</td>
  <td><code>!</code> <code>-</code></td>
  <td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Multiplication</td>
  <td><code>/</code> <code>*</code></td>
  <td>Left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Addition</td>
  <td><code>-</code> <code>+</code></td>
  <td>Left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Comparison</td>
  <td><code>&gt;</code> <code>&gt;=</code>
      <code>&lt;</code> <code>&lt;=</code></td>
  <td>Left</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Equality</td>
  <td><code>==</code> <code>!=</code></td>
  <td>Left</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

How do we <span name="massage">stuff these restrictions</span> into our
context-free grammar? Right now, when we have an expression that contains
subexpressions, like a binary operator, we allow *any* expression in there:

<aside name="massage">

Instead of baking precedence right into the grammar rules, some parser
generators let you keep the same ambiguous-but-simple grammar and then add in a
little explicit operator precedence metadata on the side in order to
disambiguate.

</aside>

```lox
binary → expression operator expression ;
```

The `expression` nonterminal allows us to pick any kind of expression as an
operand, regardless of the operator we picked. The rules of precedence limit
that. For example, an operand of a `*` expression cannot be a `+` <span
name="paren">expression</span>, since the latter has lower precedence.

<aside name="paren">

Of course, it could be a *parenthesized* addition expression, but that's because
the parentheses themselves are treated as having the highest precedence.

</aside>

For the multiplication operands, we need a nonterminal that means "any kind of
expression of higher precedence than `*`". Something like:

```lox
multiplication → higherThanMultiply "*" higherThanMultiply ;
```

Since `*` and `/` have the same precedence and the level above them is unary
operators, a better approximation is:

```lox
multiplication → unary ( "*" | "/" ) unary ;
```

Except that's not *quite* right. We broke associativity. This `multiplication`
rule doesn't allow `1 * 2 * 3`. To support associativity, we make one side
permit expressions at the *same* level. Which side we choose determines if the
operator is left- or right-associative. Since multiplication and <span
name="div">division</span> are left-associative, it's:

<aside name="div">

In principle, it doesn't matter whether you treat multiplication as left- or
right-associative -- you get the same result either way. Alas, in the real world
with limited precision, roundoff and overflow mean that associativity can affect
the result of a sequence of multiplications. Consider:

```lox
print 0.1 + (0.2 + 0.3);
print (0.1 + 0.2) + 0.3;
```

In languages like Lox that use [IEEE 754][754] double-precision floating-point
numbers, the first evaluates to `0.6`, while the second yields
`0.6000000000000001`. Sometimes that tiny difference matters.
[This][float] is a good place to learn more.

[754]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format
[float]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html

</aside>

```lox
multiplication → multiplication ( "*" | "/" ) unary ;
```

This is correct, but the fact that the first nonterminal in the body of the rule
is the same as the head of the rule means this production is **left-recursive**.
Some parsing techniques, including the one we're going to use, have trouble with
left recursion. Instead, we'll use this other style:

```lox
multiplication → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
```

At the grammar level, this sidesteps left recursion by saying a multiplication
expression is a flat *sequence* of multiplications and divisions. This mirrors
the code we'll use to parse a sequence of multiplications.

If we rejigger all of the binary operator rules in the same way, we get:

```lox
expression     → equality ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → addition ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) addition )* ;
addition       → multiplication ( ( "-" | "+" ) multiplication )* ;
multiplication → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "false" | "true" | "nil"
               | "(" expression ")" ;
```

Instead of a single `binary` rule, there are now four separate rules for each binary operator precedence level. The main `expression` rule is no longer a flat series of `|` branches for each kind of expression. Instead, it is simply an alias for the lowest-precedence expression form, <span name="equality">`equality`</span>, because that includes all higher-precedence expressions too.

<aside name="equality">

In later chapters, when we expand the grammar to include assignment and logical
operators, this will change, but equality is the lowest for now.

</aside>

Each binary operator's operands use the next-higher precedence level. After the
binary operators, we go to `unary`, the rule for unary operator expressions,
since those bind tighter than binary ones. For `unary`, we *do* use a recursive
rule because unary operators are right-associative, which means instead of left
recursion, we have **right recursion**. The `unary` nonterminal is at the end of
the body for `unary`, not the beginning, and our parser won't have any trouble
with that.

Finally, the `unary` rule alternately bubbles up to `primary` in cases where it
doesn't match a unary operator. "Primary" is the time-honored name for the
highest level of precedence including the atomic expressions like literals.

Our grammar grew a bit, but it's unambiguous now. We're ready to make a parser
for it.

## Recursive Descent Parsing

There is a whole pack of parsing techniques whose names mostly seem to be
combinations of "L" and "R" -- [LL(k)][], [LR(1)][lr], [LALR][] -- along with
more exotic beasts like [parser combinators][], [Earley parsers][], [the
shunting yard algorithm][], and [packrat parsing][]. For our first interpreter,
one technique is more than sufficient: **recursive descent**.

[ll(k)]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser
[lr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser
[lalr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser
[parser combinators]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator
[earley parsers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser
[the shunting yard algorithm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm
[packrat parsing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

Recursive descent is the simplest way to build a parser, and doesn't require
using complex parser generator tools like Yacc, Bison or ANTLR. All you need is
straightforward hand-written code. Don't be fooled by its simplicity, though.
Recursive descent parsers are fast, robust, and can support sophisticated
error-handling. In fact, GCC, V8 (the JavaScript VM in Chrome), Roslyn (the C#
compiler written in C#) and many other heavyweight production language
implementations use recursive descent. It kicks ass.

It is considered a **top-down parser** because it starts from the top or
outermost grammar rule (here `expression`) and works its way <span
name="descent">down</span> into the nested subexpressions before finally
reaching the leaves of the syntax tree. This is in contrast with bottom-up
parsers like LR that start with primary expressions and compose them into larger
and larger chunks of syntax.

<aside name="descent">

It's called "recursive *descent*" because it walks *down* the grammar.
Confusingly, we also use direction metaphorically when talking about "high" and
"low" precedence, but the orientation is reversed. In a top-down parser, you
reach the lowest-precedence expressions first because they may in turn contain
subexpressions of higher precedence.

![Top-down grammar rules in order of increasing precedence.](image/parsing-expressions/direction.png)

CS people really need to get together and straighten out their metaphors. Don't
even get me started on which direction the stack is supposed to grow.

</aside>

A recursive descent parser is a literal translation of the grammar's rules
straight into imperative code. Each rule becomes a function. The body of the
rule translates to code roughly like:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <td>Grammar notation</td>
  <td>Code representation</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td>Terminal</td><td>Code to match and consume a token</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Nonterminal</td><td>Call to that rule&rsquo;s function</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>|</code></td><td>If or switch statement</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>*</code> or <code>+</code></td><td>While or for loop</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>?</code></td><td>If statement</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It's called "*recursive* descent" because when a grammar rule refers to itself
-- directly or indirectly -- that translates to recursive method calls.

### The parser class

Each grammar rule becomes a method inside this new class:

^code parser

Like the scanner, it consumes a sequence, only now we're working at the level of
entire tokens. It takes in a list of tokens and uses `current` to point to the
next token eagerly waiting to be used.

We're going to run straight through the expression grammar now and translate
each rule to Java code. The first rule, `expression`, simply expands to the
`equality` rule, so that's straightforward:

^code expression

Each method for parsing a grammar rule produces a syntax tree for that rule and
returns it to the caller. When the body of the rule contains a nonterminal -- a
reference to another rule -- we <span name="left">call</span> that rule's
method.

<aside name="left">

This is why left recursion is problematic for recursive descent. The function
for a left-recursive rule immediately calls itself, which calls itself again,
and so on, until the parser hits a stack overflow and dies.

</aside>

The rule for equality is a little more complex:

```lox
equality → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
```

In Java, that becomes:

^code equality

Let's step through it. The left `comparison` nonterminal in the body is
translated to the first call to `comparison()` and we store that in a local
variable.

Then, the `( ... )*` loop in the rule is mapped to a while loop. We need to know
when to exit that loop. We can see that inside the rule, we must first find
either a `!=` or `==` token. So, if we *don't* see one of those, we must be done
with the sequence of equality operators. We express that check using a handy
`match()` method:

^code match

This checks to see if the current token is any of the given types. If so, it
consumes the token and returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false` and leaves
the token as the current one.

The `match()` method is defined in terms of two more fundamental operations:

^code check

This returns `true` if the current token is of the given type. Unlike `match()`,
it doesn't consume the token, it only looks at it.

^code advance

This consumes the current token and returns it, similar to how our scanner's
`advance()` method did with characters.

These methods bottom out on the last handful of primitive operations:

^code utils

`isAtEnd()` checks if we've run out of tokens to parse. `peek()` returns the
current token we have yet to consume and `previous()` returns the most recently
consumed token. The latter makes it easier to use `match()` and then access the
just-matched token.

That's most of the parsing infrastructure we need. Where were we? Right, so if
we are inside the while loop in `equality()`, then the parser knows it found a
`!=` or `==` operator and must be parsing an equality expression.

It grabs the token that was matched for the operator so we can track which kind
of binary expression this is. Then it calls `comparison()` again to parse the
right-hand operand. It combines the operator and the two operands into a new
`Expr.Binary` syntax tree node, and then loops around. Each time, it stores the
expression back in the same `expr` local variable. As it zips through a sequence
of equality expressions, that creates a left-associative nested tree of binary
operator nodes.

<span name="sequence"></span>

<img src="image/parsing-expressions/sequence.png" alt="The syntax tree created by parsing 'a == b == c == d == e'" />

<aside name="sequence">

Parsing `a == b == c == d == e`. Each iteration, we create a new binary
expression using the previous one as the left operand.

</aside>

The parser falls out of the loop once it hits a token that's not an equality
operator. Finally, it returns the expression. Note that if it doesn't encounter
a single equality operator, then it never enters the loop. In that case, the
`equality()` method effectively calls and returns `comparison()`. In that way,
this method matches an equality operator *or anything of higher precedence*.

Moving on to the next rule...

```lox
comparison → addition ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) addition )* ;
```

Translated to Java:

^code comparison

The grammar rule is virtually identical to `equality` and so is the
corresponding code. The only <span name="handle">differences</span> are the
token types for the operators we match, and the method we call for the operands,
now `addition()` instead of `comparison()`. The remaining two binary operator
rules follow the same pattern:

<aside name="handle">

If you wanted to do some clever Java 8, you could create a helper method for
parsing a left-associative series of binary operators given a list of token
types and an operand method handle and unify some of this redundant code.

</aside>

^code addition-and-multiplication

That's all of the binary operators, parsed with the correct precedence and
associativity. We're crawling up the precedence hierarchy and now we've reached
the unary operators:

```lox
unary → ( "!" | "-" ) unary
      | primary ;
```

The code for this is a little different:

^code unary

Again, we look at the <span name="current">current<span> token to see how to
parse. If it's a `!` or `-`, we must have a unary expression. In that case, we
grab the token, and then recursively call `unary()` again to parse the operand.
Wrap that all up in a unary expression syntax tree and we're done.

<aside name="current">

The fact that the parser looks ahead at upcoming tokens to decide how to parse
puts recursive descent into the category of **predictive parsers**.

</aside>

Otherwise, we must have reached the highest level of precedence, primary
expressions.

```lox
primary → NUMBER | STRING | "false" | "true" | "nil"
        | "(" expression ")" ;
```

Most of the cases for the rule are single terminals, so it's pretty
straightforward:

^code primary

The interesting branch is the one for handling parentheses. After we match an
opening `(` and parse the expression inside it, we *must* find a `)` token. If
we don't, that's an error.

## Syntax Errors

A parser really has two jobs:

1.  Given a valid sequence of tokens, produce a corresponding syntax tree.

2.  Given an *invalid* sequence of tokens, detect any errors and tell the
    user about their mistakes.

Don't underestimate how important the second job is! In modern IDEs and editors,
the parser is constantly reparsing code -- often while the user is still editing
it -- in order to syntax highlight and support things like auto-complete. That
means it will encounter code in incomplete, half-wrong states *all the time.*

When the user doesn't realize the syntax is wrong, it is up to the parser to
help guide them back onto the right path. The way it reports errors is a large
part of your language's user interface. Good syntax error handling is hard. By
definition, the code isn't in a well-defined state, so there's no infallible way
to know what the user *meant* to write. The parser can't read your <span
name="telepathy">mind</span>.

<aside name="telepathy">

Not yet at least. With the way things are going in machine learning these days,
who knows what the future will bring?

</aside>

There are a couple of hard requirements for when the parser runs into a syntax
error:

*   **It must detect and report the error.** If it doesn't detect the <span
    name="error">error</span> and passes the resulting malformed syntax tree on
    to the interpreter, all manner of horrors may be summoned.

    <aside name="error">

    Philosophically speaking, if an error isn't detected and the interpreter
    runs the code, is it *really* an error?

    </aside>

*   **It must not crash or hang.** Syntax errors are a fact of life and language
    tools have to be robust in the face of them. Segfaulting or getting stuck in
    an infinite loop isn't allowed. While the source may not be valid *code*,
    it's still a valid *input to the parser* because users use the parser to
    learn what syntax is allowed.

Those are the table stakes if you want to get in the parser game at all, but you
really want to raise the ante beyond that. A decent parser should:

*   **Be fast.** Computers are thousands of times faster than they were when
    parser technology was first invented. The days of needing to optimize your
    parser so that it could get through an entire source file during a coffee
    break are over. But programmer expectations have risen as quickly, if not
    faster. They expect their editors to reparse files in milliseconds after
    every keystroke.

*   **Report as many distinct errors as there are.** Aborting after the first
    error is easy to implement, but it's annoying for users if every time they
    fix what they think is the one error in a file, a new one appears. They
    want to see them all.

*   **Minimize *cascaded* errors.** Once a single error is found, the parser no
    longer really knows what's going on. It tries to get itself back on track
    and keep going, but if it gets confused, it may report a slew of ghost
    errors that don't indicate other real problems in the code. When the first
    error is fixed, they disappear, because they merely represent the parser's
    own confusion. These are annoying because they can scare the user into
    thinking their code is in a worse state than it is.

The last two points are in tension. We want to report as many separate errors as
we can, but we don't want to report ones that are merely side effects of an
earlier one.

The way a parser responds to an error and keeps going to look for later errors
is called **"error recovery"**. It was a hot research topic in the 60s. Back
then, you'd hand a stack of punch cards to the secretary and come back the next
day to see if the compiler succeeded. With an iteration loop that slow, you
*really* wanted to find every single error in your code in one pass.

Today, when parsers complete before you've even finished typing, it's less of an
issue. Simple, fast error recovery is fine.

### Panic mode error recovery

<aside name="panic">

You know you want to push it.

![A big shiny "PANIC" button.](image/parsing-expressions/panic.png)

</aside>

Of all the recovery techniques devised in yesteryear, the one that best stood
the test of time is called -- somewhat alarmingly -- <span name="panic">"panic
mode"</span>. As soon as the parser detects an error, it enters panic mode. It
knows at least one token doesn't make sense given its current state in the
middle of some stack of grammar productions.

Before it can get back to parsing, it needs to get its state and the sequence of
forthcoming tokens aligned such that the next token does match the rule being
parsed. This process is called **synchronization**.

To do that, we select some rule in the grammar that will mark the
synchronization point. The parser fixes its parsing state by jumping out of any
nested productions until it gets back to that rule. Then it synchronizes the
token stream by discarding tokens until it reaches one that can appear at that
point in the rule.

Any additional real syntax errors hiding in those discarded tokens aren't
reported, but it also means that any mistaken cascaded errors that are side
effects of the initial error aren't *falsely* reported either, which is a decent
trade-off.

The traditional place in the grammar to synchronize is between statements. We
don't have those yet, so we won't actually synchronize in this chapter, but
we'll get the machinery in place for later.

### Entering panic mode

Back before we went on this side trek about error recovery, we were writing the
code to parse a parenthesized expression. After parsing the expression, it
looks for the closing `)` by calling `consume()`. Here, finally, is that method:

^code consume

It's similar to `match()` in that it checks to see if the next token is of the
expected type. If so, it consumes it and everything is groovy. If some other
token is there, then we've hit an error. We report it by calling this:

^code error

First, that shows the error to the user by calling:

^code token-error

This reports an error at a given token. It shows the token's location and the
token itself. This will come in handy later since we use tokens throughout the
interpreter to track locations in code.

After this is called, the user knows about the syntax error, but what does the
*parser* do next? Back in `error()`, it creates and returns a ParseError, an
instance of:

^code parse-error (1 before, 1 after)

This is a simple sentinel class we use to unwind the parser. The `error()`
method *returns* it instead of *throwing* because we want to let the caller
decide whether to unwind or not.

Some parse errors occur in places where the parser isn't likely to get into a
weird state and we don't need to <span name="production">synchronize</span>. In
those places, we simply report the error and keep on truckin'. For example, Lox
limits the number of arguments you can pass to a function. If you pass too many,
the parser needs to report that error, but it can and should simply keep on
parsing the extra arguments instead of freaking out and going into panic mode.

<aside name="production">

Another way to handle common syntax errors is with **error productions**. You
augment the grammar with a rule that matches the erroneous syntax. The parser
safely parses it but then reports it as an error instead of producing a syntax
tree.

For example, some languages have a unary `+` operator, like `+123`, but Lox does
not. Instead of getting confused when the parser stumbles onto a `+` at the
beginning of an expression, we could extend the unary rule to allow it:

```lox
unary → ( "!" | "-" | "+" ) unary
        | primary ;
```

This lets the parser consume `+` without going into panic mode or leaving the
parser in a weird state.

Error productions work well because you, the parser author, know *how* the code
is wrong and what the user was likely trying to do. That means you can give a
more helpful message to get the user back on track, like, "Unary '+' expressions
are not supported." Mature parsers tend to accumulate error productions like
barnacles since they help users fix common mistakes.

</aside>

In our case, though, the syntax error is nasty enough that we want to panic and
synchronize. Discarding tokens is pretty easy, but how do we synchronize the
parser's own state?

### Synchronizing a recursive descent parser

With recursive descent, the parser's state -- which rules it is in the middle of
recognizing -- is not stored explicitly in fields. Instead, we use Java's
own call stack to track what the parser is doing. Each rule in the process of
being parsed is a callframe on the stack. In order to reset that state, we need
to clear out those callframes.

The natural way to do that in Java is exceptions. When we want to synchronize,
we *throw* that ParseError object. Higher up in the method for the grammar rule
we are synchronizing to, we'll catch it. Since we are synchronizing on statement
boundaries, we'll catch the exception there. After the exception is caught, the
parser is in the right state. All that's left is to synchronize the tokens.

We want to discard tokens until we're right at the beginning of the next
statement. That boundary is pretty easy to spot -- it's one of the main reasons
we picked it. *After* a semicolon, we're <span name="semicolon">probably</span>
finished with a statement. Most statements start with a keyword -- `for`, `if`,
`return`, `var`, etc. When the *next* token is any of those, we're probably
about to start a statement.

<aside name="semicolon">

I say "probably" because we could hit a semicolon separating clauses in a for
loop. Our synchronization isn't perfect, but that's OK. We've already reported
the first error precisely, so everything after that is kind of "best effort".

</aside>

This method encapsulates that logic:

^code synchronize

It discards tokens until it thinks it found a statement boundary. After catching
a ParseError, we'll call this and then we are hopefully back in sync. When it
works well, we have discarded tokens that would have likely caused cascaded
errors anyway and now we can parse the rest of the file starting at the next
statement.

Alas, we don't get to see this method in action, since we don't have statements
yet. We'll get to that [in a couple of chapters][statements]. For now, if an
error occurs, we'll panic and unwind all the way to the top and stop parsing.
Since we can only parse a single expression anyway, that's no big loss.

## Wiring up the Parser

We are mostly done parsing expressions now. There is one other place where we
need to add a little error handling. As the parser descends through the parsing
methods for each grammar rule, it eventually hits `primary()`. If none of the
cases in there match, it means we are sitting on a token that can't start an
expression. We need to handle that error too:

^code primary-error (5 before, 1 after)

With that, all that remains in the parser is to define an initial method to kick
it off. It's called, naturally enough, `parse()`:

^code parse

We'll revisit this method later when we add statements to the language. For now,
it parses a single expression and returns it. We also have some temporary code
to exit out of panic mode. Syntax error recovery is the parser's job, so we
don't want the ParseError exception to escape into the rest of the interpreter.

When a syntax error does occur, this method returns `null`. That's OK. The
parser promises not to crash or hang on invalid syntax, but it doesn't promise
to return a *usable syntax tree* if an error is found. As soon as the parser
reports an error, `hadError` gets set, and subsequent phases are skipped.

Finally, we can hook up our brand new parser to the main Lox class and try it
out. We still don't have an interpreter so, for now, we'll parse to a syntax
tree and then use the AstPrinter class from the [last chapter][ast-printer] to
display it.

[ast-printer]: representing-code.html#a-(not-very)-pretty-printer

Delete the old code to print the scanned tokens and replace it with this:

^code print-ast (1 before, 1 after)

Congratulations, you have crossed the <span name="harder">threshold</span>! That
really is all there is to hand-writing a parser. We'll extend the grammar in
later chapters with assignment, statements, and other stuff, but none of that is
any more complex than the binary operators we tackled here.

<aside name="harder">

It is possible to define a grammar that's more difficult than Lox's to parse
using recursive descent. Predictive parsing gets tricky when you may need to
look ahead a large number of tokens to figure out what you're sitting on.

In practice, most languages are designed to avoid that. Even in cases where they
aren't, you can usually hack around it without too much pain. If you can parse
C++ using recursive descent, you can parse anything.

Fire up the interpreter and type in some expressions. See how it handles
precedence and associativity correctly? Not bad for less than 200 lines of code.

## Challenges

1.  In C, a block is a statement form that allows you to pack a series of
    statements where a single one is expected. The [comma operator][] is an
    analogous syntax for expressions. A comma-separated series of expressions
    can be given where a single expression is expected (except inside a function
    call's argument list). At runtime, the comma operator evaluates the left
    operand and discards the result. Then it evaluates and returns the right
    operand.

[comma operator]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator

    Add support for comma expressions. Give them the same precedence and
    associativity as in C. Write the grammar, and then implement the necessary
    parsing code.

2.  Likewise, add support for the C-style conditional or "ternary" operator
    `?:`. What precedence level is allowed between the `?` and `:`? Is the whole
    operator left-associative or right-associative?

3.  Add error productions to handle each binary operator appearing without a
    left-hand operand. In other words, detect a binary operator appearing at the
    beginning of an expression. Report that as an error, but also parse and
    discard a right-hand operand with the appropriate precedence.

## Design Note: Logic Versus History

Let's say we decide to add bitwise `&` and `|` operators to Lox. Where should we
put them in the precedence hierarchy? C -- and most languages that follow in C's
footsteps -- place them below `==`. This is widely considered a mistake because
it means common operations like testing a flag require parentheses:

```c
if (flags & FLAG_MASK == SOME_FLAG) { ... } // Wrong.
if ((flags & FLAG_MASK) == SOME_FLAG) { ... } // Right.
```

Should we fix this for Lox and put bitwise operators higher up the precedence
table than C does? There are two strategies we can take.

You almost never want to use the result of an `==` expression as the operand to
a bitwise operator. By making bitwise bind tighter, users don't need to
parenthesize as often. So if we do that, and users assume the precedence is
chosen logically to minimize parentheses, they're likely to infer it correctly.

This kind of internal consistency makes the language easier to learn because
there are fewer edge cases and exceptions users have to stumble into and then
correct. That's good, because before users can use our language, they have to
load all of that syntax and semantics into their heads. A simpler, more rational
language *makes sense*.

But, for many users there is an even faster shortcut to getting our language's
ideas into their wetware -- *use concepts they already know.* Many newcomers to
our language will be coming from some other language or languages. If our
language uses some of the same syntax or semantics as those, there is much less
for the user to learn (and *unlearn*).

This is particularly helpful with syntax. You may not remember it well today,
but way back when you learned your very first programming language, code
probably looked alien and unapproachable. Only through painstaking effort did
you learn to read and accept it. If you design a novel syntax for your new
language, you force users to start that process all over again.

Taking advantage of what users already know is one of the most powerful tools
you can use to ease adoption of your language. It's almost impossible to
underestimate how useful this is. But it faces you with a nasty problem: What
happens when the thing the users all know *kind of sucks?* C's bitwise operator
precedence is a mistake that doesn't make sense. But it's a *familiar* mistake
that millions have already gotten used to and learned to live with.

Do you stay true to your language's own internal logic and ignore history? Do
you start from a blank slate and first principles? Or do you weave your language
into the rich tapestry of programming history and give your users a leg up by
starting from something they already know?

There is no perfect answer here, only trade-offs. You and I are obviously biased
towards liking novel languages, so our natural inclination is to burn the
history books and start our own story.

In practice, it's often better to make the most of what users already know.
Getting them to come to your language requires a big leap. The smaller you can
make that chasm, the more people will be willing to cross it. But you can't
*always* stick to history, or your language won't have anything new and
compelling to get people to *want* to jump over.
