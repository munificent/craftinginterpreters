We're going to spend the rest of this book illuminating every dark and sundry
corner of the Lox language, but it seems cruel to have you immediately start
grinding out code for the interpreter without at least a glimpse of what we're
going to end up with.

At the same time, I don't want to drag you through reams of language lawyering
and specification-ese before you get to touch your text <span
name="home">editor</span>. So this will be a gentle, friendly introduction to
Lox. It will leave out a lot of details and edge cases. We've got plenty of time
for those later.

<aside name="home">

A tutorial isn't very fun if you can't try the code out yourself. Alas, you
don't have a Lox interpreter yet, since you haven't built one!

Fear not. You can use [mine][repo].

## Hello, Lox

Here's your very first taste of <span name="salmon">Lox</span>:

<aside name="salmon">

Your first taste of Lox, the language, that is. I don't know if you've ever had
the cured, cold-smoked salmon before. If not, give it a try too.

</aside>

```lox
// Your first Lox program!
print "Hello, world!";
```

As that `//` line comment and the trailing semicolon imply, Lox's syntax is a
member of the C family. (There are no parentheses around the string because
`print` is a built-in statement, and not a library function.)

Now, I won't claim that <span name="c">C</span> has a *great* syntax. If we
wanted something elegant, we'd probably mimic Pascal or Smalltalk. If we wanted
to go full Scandinavian-furniture-minimalism, we'd do a Scheme. Those all have
their virtues.

<aside name="c">

I'm surely biased, but I think Lox's syntax is pretty clean. C's most egregious
grammar problems are around types. Dennis Ritchie had this idea called
"[declaration reflects use][use]" where variable declarations mirror the
operations you would have to perform on the variable to get to a value of the
base type. Clever idea, but I don't think it worked out great in practice.

[use]: http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/117024/why-was-the-c-syntax-for-arrays-pointers-and-functions-designed-this-way

Lox doesn't have static types, so we avoid that.

</aside>

What C-like syntax has instead is something you'll find is often more valuable
in a language: *familiarity*. I know you are already comfortable with that style
because the two languages we'll be using to *implement* Lox -- Java and C --
also inherit it. Using a similar syntax for Lox gives you one less thing to
learn.

## A High-Level Language

While this book ended up bigger than I was hoping, it's still not big enough to
fit a huge language like Java in it. In order to fit two complete
implementations of Lox in these pages, Lox itself has to be pretty compact.

When I think of languages that are small but useful, what comes to mind are
high-level "scripting" languages like <span name="js">JavaScript</span>, Scheme,
and Lua. Of those three, Lox looks most like JavaScript, mainly because most
C-syntax languages do. As we'll learn later, Lox's approach to scoping hews
closely to Scheme. The C flavor of Lox we'll build in [Part III][] is heavily
indebted to Lua's clean, efficient implementation.

[part iii]: a-bytecode-interpreter-in-c.html

<aside name="js">

Now that JavaScript has taken over the world and is used to build ginormous
applications, it's hard to think of it as a "little scripting language". But
Brendan Eich hacked it into Netscape Navigator in *ten days* to make buttons
animate on web pages. JavaScript has grown up since then, but it was once a
cute little language.

Because Eich slapped JS together with roughly the same raw materials and time as
an episode of MacGyver, it has some weird semantic corners where the duct tape
and paper clips show through. Things like variable hoisting, dynamically-bound
`this`, holes in arrays, and implicit conversions.

I had the luxury of taking my time on Lox, so it should be a little cleaner.

</aside>

Lox shares two other aspects with those three languages:

### Dynamic typing

Lox is dynamically typed. Variables can store values of any type, and a single
variable can even store values of different types at different times. If you try
to perform an operation on values of the wrong type -- say, dividing a number by
a string -- then the error is detected and reported at runtime.

There are plenty of reasons to like <span name="static">static</span> types, but
they don't outweigh the pragmatic reasons to pick dynamic types for Lox. A
static type system is a ton of work to learn and implement. Skipping it gives
you a simpler language and a shorter book. We'll get our interpreter up and
executing bits of code sooner if we defer our type checking to runtime.

<aside name="static">

After all, the two languages we'll be using to *implement* Lox are both
statically typed.

</aside>

### Automatic memory management

High-level languages exist to eliminate error-prone, low-level drudgery and what
could be more tedious than manually managing the allocation and freeing of
storage? No one rises and greets the morning sun with, "I can't wait to figure
out the correct place to call `free()` for every byte of memory I allocate
today!"

There are two main <span name="gc">techniques</span> for managing memory:
**reference counting** and **tracing garbage collection** (usually just called
**"garbage collection"** or **"GC"**). Ref counters are much simpler to
implement -- I think that's why Perl, PHP, and Python all started out using
them. But, over time, the limitations of ref counting become too troublesome.
All of those languages eventually ended up adding a full tracing GC or at least
enough of one to clean up object cycles.

<aside name="gc">

In practice, ref counting and tracing are more ends of a continuum than
opposing sides. Most ref counting systems end up doing some tracing to handle
cycles, and the write barriers of a generational collector look a bit like
retain calls if you squint.

For lots more on this, see "[A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection][gc]" (PDF).

[gc]: https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon04Unified.pdf

</aside>

Tracing garbage collection has a fearsome reputation. It *is* a little harrowing
working at the level of raw memory. Debugging a GC can sometimes leave you
seeing hex dumps in your dreams. But, remember, this book is about dispelling
magic and slaying those monsters, so we *are* going to write our own garbage
collector. I think you'll find the algorithm is quite simple and a lot of fun to
write.

## Data Types

In Lox's little universe, the atoms that make up all matter are the built-in
data types. There are only a few:

*   **<span name="bool">Booleans</span> –** You can't code without logic and you
    can't logic without Boolean values. "True" and "false", the yin and yang of
    software. Unlike some ancient languages that repurpose an existing type to
    represent truth and falsehood, Lox has a dedicated Boolean type. We may
    be roughing it on this expedition, but we aren't *savages*.

    <aside name="bool">

    Boolean variables are the only data type in Lox named after a person, George
    Boole, which is why "Boolean" is capitalized. He died in 1864, nearly a
    century before digital computers turned his algebra into electricity. I
    wonder what he'd think to see his name all over billions of lines of Java
    code.

    </aside>

    There are two Boolean values, obviously, and a literal for each one:

        :::lox
        true;  // Not false.
        false; // Not *not* false.

*   **Numbers –** Lox only has one kind of number: double-precision floating
    point. Since floating point numbers can also represent a wide range of
    integers, that covers a lot of territory, while keeping things simple.

    Full-featured languages have lots of syntax for numbers -- hexadecimal,
    scientific notation, octal, all sorts of fun stuff. We'll settle for basic
    integer and decimal literals:

        :::lox
        1234;  // An integer.
        12.34; // A decimal number.

*   **Strings –** We've already seen one string literal in the first example.
    Like most languages, they are enclosed in double quotes:

        :::lox
        "I am a string";
        "";    // The empty string.
        "123"; // This is a string, not a number.

    As we'll see when we get to implementing them, there is quite a lot of
    complexity hiding in that innocuous sequence of <span
    name="char">characters</span>.

    <aside name="char">

    Even that word "character" is a trickster. Is it ASCII? Unicode? A
    code point, or a "grapheme cluster"? How are characters encoded? Is each
    character a fixed size, or can they vary?

    </aside>

*   **Nil –** There's one last built-in value who's never invited to the party
    but always seems to show up. It represents "no value". It's called "null" in
    many other languages. In Lox we spell it `nil`. (When we get to implementing
    it, that will help distinguish when we're talking about Lox's `nil` versus
    Java or C's `null`.)

    There are good arguments for not having a null value in a language since
    null pointer errors are the scourge of our industry. If we were doing a
    statically-typed language, it would be worth trying to ban it. In a
    dynamically-typed one, though, eliminating it is often more annoying
    than having it.

## Expressions

If built-in data types and their literals are atoms, then **expressions** must
be the molecules. Most of these will be familiar.

### Arithmetic

Lox features the basic arithmetic operators you know and love from C and other
languages:

```lox
add + me;
subtract - me;
multiply * me;
divide / me;
```

The subexpressions on either side of the operator are **operands**. Because
there are *two* of them, these are called **binary** operators. (It has nothing
to do with the ones-and-zeroes use of "binary".) Because the operator is <span
name="fixity">fixed</span> *in* the middle of the operands, these are also
called ***in*fix** operators as opposed to ***pre*fix** operators where the
operator comes before and ***post*fix** where it follows the operand.

<aside name="fixity">

There are some operators that have more than two operands and where the
operators are interleaved between them. The only one in wide usage is the
"conditional" or "ternary" operator of C and friends:

```c
condition ? thenArm : elseArm;
```

Some call these **mixfix** operators. A few languages let you define your own
operator and control how it is positioned -- its "fixity".

</aside>

One arithmetic operator is actually *both* an infix and a prefix one. The `-`
operator can also be used to negate a number:

```lox
-negateMe;
```

All of these operators work on numbers, and it's an error to pass any other
types to them. The exception is the `+` operator -- you can also pass it two
strings to concatenate them.

### Comparison and equality

Moving along, we have a few more operators that always return a Boolean result.
We can compare numbers (and only numbers), using Ye Olde Comparison Operators:

```lox
less < than;
lessThan <= orEqual;
greater > than;
greaterThan >= orEqual;
```

We can test two values of any kind for equality or inequality:

```lox
1 == 2;         // false.
"cat" != "dog"; // true.
```

Even different types:

```lox
314 == "pi"; // false.
```

Values of different types are *never* equivalent:

```lox
123 == "123"; // false.
```

Like I said, I'm generally against implicit conversions.

### Logical operators

The not operator, a prefix `!`, returns `false` if its operand is true, and vice
versa:

```lox
!true;  // false.
!false; // true.
```

The other two logical operators really are control flow constructs in the guise
of expressions. An <span name="and">`and`</span> expression determines if two
values are *both* true. It returns the left operand if it's false, or the
right operand otherwise:

```lox
true and false; // false.
true and true;  // true.
```

And an `or` expression determines if *either* of two values (or both) are true.
It returns the left operand if it is true and the right operand otherwise:

```lox
false or false; // false.
true or false;  // true.
```

<aside name="and">

I used `and` and `or` for these instead of `&&` and `||` because Lox doesn't use
`&` and `|` for bitwise operators. It felt weird to introduce the
double-character forms without the single-character ones.

I also kind of like using words for these since they are really control flow
structures and not simple operators.

</aside>

The reason `and` and `or` are like control flow structures is because they
**short-circuit**. Not only does `and` return the left operand if it is false,
it doesn't even *evaluate* the right one in that case. Conversely,
("contrapositively"?) if the left operand of an `or` is true, the right is
skipped.

### Precedence and grouping

All of these operators have the same precedence and associativity that you'd
expect coming from C. (When we get to parsing, we'll get *way* more precise
about that.) In cases where the precedence isn't what you want, you can use `()`
to group stuff:

```lox
var average = (min + max) / 2;
```

Since they aren't very technically interesting, I've cut the remainder of the
typical operator menagerie out of our little language. No bitwise, shift,
modulo, or conditional operators. I'm not grading you, but you will get bonus
points in my heart if you augment your own implementation of Lox with them.

Those are the expression forms (except for a couple related to specific features
that we'll get to later), so let's move up a level.

## Statements

Now we're at statements. Where an expression's main job is to produce a *value*,
a statement's job is to produce an *effect*. Since, by definition, statements
don't evaluate to a value, to be useful they have to otherwise change the world
in some way -- usually modifying some state, reading input, or producing output.

You've seen a couple of kinds of statements already. The first one was:

```lox
print "Hello, world!";
```

A <span name="print">print statement</span> evaluates a single expression
and displays the result to the user. You've also seen some statements like:

<aside name="print">

Baking `print` into the language instead of just making it a core library
function is a hack. But it's a *useful* hack for us: it means our in-progress
interpreter can start producing output before we've implemented all of the
machinery required to define functions, look them up by name, and call them.

</aside>

```lox
"some expression";
```

An expression followed by a semicolon (`;`) promotes the expression to
statement-hood. This is called (imaginatively enough), an **expression
statement**.

If you want to pack a series of statements where a single one is expected, you
can wrap them up in a block:

```lox
{
  print "One statement.";
  print "Two statements.";
}
```

Blocks also affect scoping, which leads us to the next section...

## Variables

You declare variables using `var` statements. If you <span
name="omit">omit</span> the initializer, the variable's value defaults to `nil`:

<aside name="omit">

This is one of those cases where not having `nil` and forcing every variable to
be initialized to some value would be more annoying than dealing with `nil`
itself.

</aside>

```lox
var imAVariable = "here is my value";
var iAmNil;
```

Once declared, you can, naturally, access and assign a variable using its name:

<span name="breakfast"></span>

```lox
var breakfast = "bagels";
print breakfast; // "bagels".
breakfast = "beignets";
print breakfast; // "beignets".
```

<aside name="breakfast">

Can you tell that I tend to work on this book in the morning before I've had
anything to eat?

</aside>

I won't get into the rules for variable scope here, because we're going to spend
a surprising amount of time in later chapters mapping every square inch of the
rules. In most cases, it works like you expect coming from C or Java.

## Control Flow

It's hard to write <span name="flow">useful</span> programs if you can't skip
some code, or execute some more than once. We need some control flow. In
addition to the logical operators we already covered, Lox lifts three statements
straight from C.

<aside name="flow">

We already have `and` and `or` for branching, and we *could* use recursion to
repeat code, so that's theoretically sufficient. It would be pretty awkward to
program that way in an imperative-styled language, though.

Scheme, on the other hand, has no built-in looping constructs. It *does* rely on
recursion for repetition. Smalltalk has no built-in branching constructs, and
relies on dynamic dispatch for selectively executing code.

</aside>

An `if ()` statement executes one of two statements based on some condition:

```lox
if (condition) {
  print "yes";
} else {
  print "no";
}
```

A `while` <span name="do">loop</span> executes the body repeatedly as long as the condition expression
evaluates to true:

```lox
var a = 1;
while (a < 10) {
  print a;
  a = a + 1;
}
```

<aside name="do">

I left `do-while` loops out of Lox because they aren't that common and wouldn't
teach you anything that you won't already learn from `while`. Go ahead and add
it to your implementation if it makes you happy. It's your party.

</aside>

Finally, we have `for` loops:

```lox
for (var a = 1; a < 10; a = a + 1) {
  print a;
}
```

This loop does the same thing as the previous `while` loop. Most modern
languages also have some sort of <span name="foreach">`for-in`</span> or
`foreach` loop for explicitly iterating over various sequence types. In a real
language, that's nicer than the crude C-style `for` loop we got here. Lox keeps
it basic.

<aside name="foreach">

This is a concession I made because of how the implementation is split across
chapters. A `for-in` loop needs some sort of dynamic dispatch in the iterator
protocol to handle different kinds of sequences, but we don't get that until
after we're done with control flow. We could circle back and add `for-in` loops
later, but I didn't think doing so would teach you anything super interesting.

</aside>

## Functions

A function call expression looks the same as it does in C:

```lox
makeBreakfast(bacon, eggs, toast);
```

You can also call a function without passing anything to it:

```lox
makeBreakfast();
```

Unlike, say, Ruby, the parentheses are mandatory in this case. If you leave them
off, it doesn't *call* the function, it just refers to it.

A language isn't very fun if you can't define your own functions. In Lox, you do
that with <span name="fun">`fun`</span>:

<aside name="fun">

I've seen languages that use `fn`, `fun`, `func`, and `function`. I'm still
hoping to discover a `funct`, `functi` or `functio` somewhere.

</aside>

```lox
fun printSum(a, b) {
  print a + b;
}
```

Now's a good time to clarify some terminology. Some people throw around
"parameter" and "argument" like they are interchangeable and, to many, they are.
We're going to spend a lot of time splitting the finest of downy hairs around
semantics, so let's sharpen our words. From here on out:

*   An **argument** is an actual value you pass to a function when you call it.
    So a function *call* has an *argument* list. Sometimes you hear **"actual
    parameter"** used for these.

*   A **parameter** is a variable that holds the value of the argument inside
    the body of the function. Thus, a function *declaration* has a *parameter*
    list. Others call these **"formal parameters"** or simply **"formals"**.

The body of a function is always a block. Inside it, you can return a value
using a `return` statement:

```lox
fun returnSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

If execution reaches the end of the block without hitting a `return`, it
<span name="sneaky">implicitly</span> returns `nil`.

<aside name="sneaky">

See, I told you `nil` would sneak in when we weren't looking.

</aside>

### Closures

Functions are *first class* in Lox, which just means they are real values that
you can get a reference to, store in variables, pass around, etc. This works:

```lox
fun addPair(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

fun identity(a) {
  return a;
}

print identity(addPair)(1, 2); // Prints "3".
```

Since function declarations are statements, you can declare local functions
inside another function:

```lox
fun outerFunction() {
  fun localFunction() {
    print "I'm local!";
  }

  localFunction();
}
```

If you combine local functions, first-class functions, and block scope, you run
into this interesting situation:

```lox
fun returnFunction() {
  var outside = "outside";

  fun inner() {
    print outside;
  }

  return inner;
}

var fn = returnFunction();
fn();
```

Here, `inner()` accesses a local variable declared outside of its body in the
surrounding function. Is this kosher? Now that lots of languages have borrowed
this feature from Lisp, you probably know the answer is yes.

For that to work, `inner()` has to "hold on" to references to any surrounding
variables that it uses so that they stay around even after the outer function
has returned. We call functions that do this <span
name="closure">**"closures"**</span>. These days, the term is often used for
*any* first-class function, though it's sort of a misnomer if the function
doesn't happen to close over any variables.

<aside name="closure">

Peter J. Landin coined the term. Yes, he coined damn near half the terms in
programming languages. Most of them came out of one incredible paper, "[The Next
700 Programming Languages][svh]".

[svh]: https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/papers-we-love/landin-next-700.pdf

In order to implement these kind of functions, you need to create a data
structure that bundles together the function's code, and the surrounding
variables it needs. He called this a "closure" because it "closes over" and
holds onto the variables it needs.

</aside>

As you can imagine, implementing these adds some complexity because we can no
longer assume variable scope works strictly like a stack where local variables
evaporate the moment the function returns. We're going to have a fun time
learning how to make these work and do so efficiently.

## Classes

Since Lox has dynamic typing, lexical (roughly, "block") scope, and closures,
it's about halfway to being a functional language. But as you'll see, it's
*also* about halfway to being an object-oriented language. Both paradigms have a
lot going for them, so I thought it was worth covering some of each.

Since classes have come under fire for not living up to their hype, let me first
explain why I put them into Lox and this book. There are really two questions:

### Why might any language want to be object oriented?

Now that object-oriented languages like Java have sold out and only play arena
shows, it's not cool to like them anymore. Why would anyone make a *new*
language with objects? Isn't that like releasing music on 8-track?

It is true that the "all inheritance all the time" binge of the 90s produced
some monstrous class hierarchies, but object-oriented programming is still
pretty rad. Billions of lines of successful code have been written in OOP
languages, shipping millions of apps to happy users. Likely a majority of
working programmers today are using an object-oriented language. They can't all
be *that* wrong.

In particular, for a dynamically-typed language, objects are pretty handy. We
need *some* way of defining compound data types to bundle blobs of stuff
together.

If we can also hang methods off of those, then we avoid the need to prefix all
of our functions with the name of the data type they operate on to avoid
colliding with similar functions for different types. In, say, Racket, you end
up having to name your functions like `hash-copy` (to copy a hash table) and
`vector-copy` (to copy a vector) so that they don't step on each other. Methods
are scoped to the object, so that problem goes away.

### Why is Lox object oriented?

I could claim objects are groovy but still out of scope for the book. Most
programming language books, especially ones that try to implement a whole
language, leave objects out. To me, that means the topic isn't well covered.
With such a widespread paradigm, that omission makes me sad.

Given how many of us spend all day *using* OOP languages, it seems like the
world could use a little documentation on how to *make* one. As you'll see, it
turns out to be pretty interesting. Not as hard as you might fear, but not as
simple as you might presume, either.

### Classes or prototypes?

When it comes to objects, there are actually two approaches to them, [classes][]
and [prototypes][]. Classes came first, and are more common thanks to C++, Java,
C#, and friends. Prototypes were a virtually forgotten offshoot until JavaScript
accidentally took over the world.

[classes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming
[prototypes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming

In a class-based language, there are two core concepts: instances and classes.
Instances store the state for each object and have a reference to the instance's
class. Classes contain the methods and inheritance chain. To call a method on an
instance, there is always a level of indirection. You look up the instance's
class and then you find the method *there*:

<img src="image/the-lox-language/class-lookup.png" alt="How fields and methods are looked up on classes and instances" />

Prototype-based languages <span name="blurry">merge</span> these two concepts.
There are only objects -- no classes -- and each individual object may contain
state and methods. Objects can directly inherit from each other (or "delegate
to" in prototypal lingo):

<aside name="blurry">

In practice the line between class-based and prototype-based languages blurs.
JavaScript's "constructor function" notion [pushes you pretty hard][js new]
towards defining class-like objects. Meanwhile, class-based Ruby is perfectly
happy to let you attach methods to individual instances.

[js new]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/prototype.html#what-about-javascript

</aside>

<img src="image/the-lox-language/prototype-lookup.png" alt="How fields and methods are looked up in a prototypal system" />

This means prototypal languages are more fundamental in some way than classes.
They are really neat to implement because they're *so* simple. Also, they can
express lots of unusual patterns that classes steer you away from.

But I've looked at a *lot* of code written in prototypal languages -- including
[some of my own devising][finch]. Do you know what people generally do with all
of the power and flexibility of prototypes? ...They use it to reinvent
classes.

[finch]: http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/

I don't know *why* that is, but people naturally seem to prefer a class-based
("Classic"? "Classy"?) style. Prototypes *are* simpler in the language, but they
seem to accomplish that only by <span name="waterbed">pushing</span> the
complexity onto the user. So, for Lox, we'll save our users the trouble and bake
classes right in.

<aside name="waterbed">

Larry Wall, Perl's inventor/prophet calls this the "[waterbed
theory][]". Some complexity is essential and cannot be eliminated. If you push
it down in one place it swells up in another.

Prototypal languages don't so much *eliminate* the complexity of classes as they
do make the *user* take that complexity by building their own class-like
metaprogramming libraries.

[waterbed theory]: http://wiki.c2.com/?WaterbedTheory

</aside>

### Classes in Lox

Enough rationale, let's see what we actually have. Classes encompass a
constellation of features in most languages. For Lox, I've selected what I think
are the brightest stars. You declare a class and its methods like so:

```lox
class Breakfast {
  cook() {
    print "Eggs a-fryin'!";
  }

  serve(who) {
    print "Enjoy your breakfast, " + who + ".";
  }
}
```

The body of a class contains its methods. They look like function declarations
but without the `fun` <span name="method">keyword</span>. When the class
declaration is executed, it creates a class object and stores it in a variable
named after the class. Just like functions, classes are first class in Lox:

<aside name="method">

They are still just as fun, though.

</aside>

```lox
// Store it in variables.
var someVariable = Breakfast;

// Pass it to functions.
someFunction(Breakfast);
```

Next, we need a way to create instances. We could add some sort of `new`
keyword, but to keep things simple, in Lox the class itself is a factory
function for instances. Call a class like a function and it produces a new
instance of itself:

```lox
var breakfast = Breakfast();
print breakfast; // "Breakfast instance".
```

### Instantiation and initialization

Classes that only have behavior aren't super useful. The idea behind
object-oriented programming is encapsulating behavior *and state* together. To
do that, you need fields. Lox, like other dynamically-typed languages, lets you
freely add properties onto objects:

```lox
breakfast.meat = "sausage";
breakfast.bread = "sourdough";
```

Assigning to a field creates it if it doesn't already exist.

If you want to access a field or method on the current object from within a
method, you use good old `this`:

```lox
class Breakfast {
  serve(who) {
    print "Enjoy your " + this.meat + " and " +
        this.bread + ", " + who + ".";
  }

  // ...
}
```

Part of encapsulating data within an object is ensuring the object is in a valid
state when it's created. To do that, you can define an initializer. If your
class has a method named `init()`, it is called automatically when the object is
constructed. Any parameters passed to the class are forwarded to its
initializer:

```lox
class Breakfast {
  init(meat, bread) {
    this.meat = meat;
    this.bread = bread;
  }

  // ...
}

var baconAndToast = Breakfast("bacon", "toast");
baconAndToast.serve("Dear Reader");
// "Enjoy your bacon and toast, Dear Reader."
```

### Inheritance

Every object-oriented language lets you not only define methods, but reuse them
across multiple classes or objects. For that, Lox supports single inheritance.
When you declare a class, you can specify a class that it inherits from using
<span name="less">`<`</span>:

```lox
class Brunch < Breakfast {
  drink() {
    print "How about a Bloody Mary?";
  }
}
```

<aside name="less">

Why the `<` operator? I didn't feel like introducing a new keyword like
`extends`. Lox doesn't use `:` for anything else so I didn't want to reserve
that either. Instead, I took a page from Ruby and used `<`.

If you know any type theory, you'll notice it's not a *totally* arbitrary
choice. Every instance of a subclass is an instance of its superclass too, but
there may be instances of the superclass that are not instances of the subclass.
That means, in the universe of possible objects, the subclass has fewer than the
superclass. Its set of objects is "smaller", though type nerds usually use `<:`
for that relation.

</aside>

Here, Brunch is the **derived class** or **subclass**, and Breakfast is the
**base class** or **superclass**. Every method defined in the superclass is also
available to its subclasses:

```lox
var benedict = Brunch("ham", "English muffin");
benedict.serve("Noble Reader");
```

Even the `init()` method gets inherited. In practice, the subclass usually wants
to define its own `init()` method too. But the original one also needs to be
called so that the superclass can maintain its state. We need some way to call a
method on our own *instance* without hitting our own *methods*.

As in Java, you use `super` for that:

```lox
class Brunch < Breakfast {
  init(meat, bread, drink) {
    super.init(meat, bread);
    this.drink = drink;
  }
}
```

That's about it. I tried to keep it minimal. The structure of the book did force
one compromise. Lox is not a *pure* object-oriented language. In a true OOP
language every object is an instance of a class, even primitive ones like
numbers and Booleans.

Because we don't implement classes until well after we start working with the
built-in types, that would have been hard. So values of primitive types aren't
real objects in the sense of being instances of classes. They don't have methods
or properties. If I were trying to make Lox a real language for real users, I
would fix that.

## The Standard Library

We're almost done. That's the whole language, so all that's left is the "core"
or "standard" library -- the set of functionality that is implemented directly
in the interpreter and that all user-defined behavior is built on top of.

This is the saddest part of Lox. Its standard library goes beyond minimalism and
veers close to outright nihilism. For the sample code in the book, we only need
to demonstrate that code is running and doing what it's supposed to do. For
that, we already have the built-in `print` statement.

Later, when we start optimizing, we'll write some benchmarks and see how long it
takes to execute code. That means we need to track time, so we'll define one
built-in function `clock()` that returns the number of seconds since the
application started.

And... that's it. I know, right? It's embarrassing.

If you wanted to turn Lox into an actual useful language, the very first thing
you should do is flesh this out. String manipulation, trigonometric functions,
file I/O, networking, heck, even *reading input from the user* would help. But we
don't need any of that for this book, and adding it wouldn't teach you anything
interesting, so I left it out.

Don't worry, we'll have plenty of exciting stuff in the language itself to keep
us busy.

## Challenges

1. Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations
   of Lox in [my repository][repo]). Try to come up with edge case behavior I
   didn't specify here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?

2. This informal introduction leaves a *lot* unspecified. List several open
   questions you have about the language's syntax and semantics. What do you
   think the answers should be?

3. Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that
   would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard
   library, of course.)

## Design Note: Expressions and Statements

Lox has both expressions and statements. Some languages omit the latter.
Instead, they treat declarations and control flow constructs as expressions too.
These "everything is an expression" languages tend to have functional pedigrees
and include most Lisps, SML, Haskell, Ruby, and CoffeeScript.

To do that, for each "statement-like" construct in the language, you need to
decide what value it evaluates to. Some of those are easy:

*   An `if` expression evaluates to the result of whichever branch is chosen.
    Likewise, a `switch` or other multi-way branch evaluates to whichever case
    is picked.

*   A variable declaration evaluates to the value of the variable.

*   A block evaluates to the result of the last expression in the sequence.

Some get a little stranger. What should a loop evaluate to? A `while` loop in
CoffeeScript evaluates to an array containing each element that the body
evaluated to. That can be handy, or a waste of memory if you don't need the
array.

You also have to decide how these statement-like expressions compose with other
expressions -- you have to fit them into the grammar's precedence table. For
example, Ruby allows:

```ruby
puts 1 + if true then 2 else 3 end + 4
```

Is this what you'd expect? Is it what your *users* expect? How does this affect
how you design the syntax for your "statements"? Note that Ruby has an explicit
`end` to tell when the `if` expression is complete. Without it, the `+ 4` would
likely be parsed as part of the `else` clause.

Turning every statement into an expression forces you to answer a few hairy
questions like that. In return, you eliminate some redundancy. C has both blocks
for sequencing statements, and the comma operator for sequencing expressions. It
has both the `if` statement and the `?:` conditional operator. If everything was
an expression in C, you could unify each of those.

Languages that do away with statements usually also feature **implicit returns**
-- a function automatically returns whatever value its body evaluates to without
need for some explicit `return` syntax. For small functions and methods, this is
really handy. In fact, many languages that do have statements have added syntax
like `=>` to be able to define functions whose body is the result of evaluating
a single expression.

But making *all* functions work that way can be a little strange. If you aren't
careful, your function will leak a return value even if you only intend it to
produce a side effect. In practice, though, users of these languages don't find
it to be a problem.

For Lox, I gave it statements for prosaic reasons. I picked a C-like syntax for
familiarity's sake, and trying to take the existing C statement syntax and
interpret it like expressions gets weird pretty fast.
