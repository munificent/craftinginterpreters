Our Java interpreter, jlox, covers a lot of territory, but it's not perfect.
First, if you run any interesting Lox programs on it, you'll discover it's
achingly slow. The style of interpretation it uses -- walking the AST directly
-- is good enough for *some* real-world uses, but leaves a lot to be desired for
a general-purpose scripting language.

Also, we implicitly rely on some fundamental stuff from the JVM itself. We take
for granted that things like `instanceof` in Java work *somehow*. And we never
for a second worry about memory management because the JVM's garbage collector
takes care of it for us.

Those were useful training wheels while we were learning the basic concepts
around interpreters. But now that we have those concepts down, it's time for us
to take those wheels off and build our own virtual machine from scratch using
nothing more than the C standard library...
