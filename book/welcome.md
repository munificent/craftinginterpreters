This may be the beginning of a grand adventure. Programming languages encompass
a huge space to explore, play in, and perhaps carve out your own territory where
you build something new for others to use. Brilliant computer scientists and
software engineers have spent entire careers traversing this land without ever
reaching the end. If this book is your first entry into the country, welcome.

The pages of this book give you a guided tour through a corner of the world of
languages. But before we strap on our hiking boots and venture out, we should
familiarize ourselves with the territory. The chapters in this part introduce
you to the basic concepts used by programming languages and how they are
organized.

We will also get acquainted with Lox, the language we'll spend the rest of the
book implementing (twice). Let's go!
