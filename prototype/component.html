<h1>Component</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re building a platformer. The Italian plumber demographic is
covered, so ours will star a Danish <span name="baker">baker</span>, Bj&oslash;rn. It
stands to reason that we&#8217;ll have a class representing our friendly pastry chef,
and it will contain everything he does in the game.</p>
<aside name="baker">

<p>Brilliant game ideas like this are why I&#8217;m a programmer and not a designer.</p>
</aside>

<p>Since the player controls him, that means reading controller input and
translating that input into motion. And, of course, he needs to interact with the level,
so some physics and collision go in there. Once that&#8217;s done, he&#8217;s got to show
up on screen, so toss in animation and rendering. He&#8217;ll probably play some
sounds too.</p>
<p>Hold on a minute; this is getting out of control. Software Architecture 101
tells us that different domains in a program should be kept isolated from each
other. If we&#8217;re making a word processor, the code that handles printing
shouldn&#8217;t be affected by the code that loads and saves documents. A game doesn&#8217;t
have the same domains as a business app, but the rule still applies.</p>
<p>As much as possible, we don&#8217;t want AI, physics, rendering, sound and other
domains to know about each other, but now we&#8217;ve got all of that crammed into one
class. We&#8217;ve seen where this road leads to: a 5,000-line dumping ground source
file so big that only the bravest ninja coders on your team even dare to go in
there.</p>
<p>This is great job security for the few who can tame it, but it&#8217;s hell for the rest of
us. A class that big means even the most seemingly trivial changes can have
far-reaching implications. Soon, the class collects <em>bugs</em> faster than it
collects <em>features</em>.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-gordian-knot" name="the-gordian-knot">The Gordian knot</a></h3>
<p>Even worse than the simple scale problem is the <span name="coupling">coupling
</span> one. All of the different systems in our game have been tied into a
giant knotted ball of code like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">collidingWithFloor</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">getRenderState</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">INVISIBLE</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">playSound</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HIT_FLOOR</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Any programmer trying to make a change in code like that will need to know
something about physics, graphics, and sound just to make sure they don&#8217;t break
anything.</p>
<aside name="coupling">

<p>While coupling like this sucks in <em>any</em> game, it&#8217;s even worse on modern games
that use concurrency. On multi-core hardware, it&#8217;s vital that code is running on
multiple threads simultaneously. One common way to split a game across threads
is along domain boundaries&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;run AI on one core, sound on another, rendering on a
third, etc.</p>
<p>Once you do that, it&#8217;s critical that those domains stay decoupled in order to
avoid deadlocks or other fiendish concurrency bugs. Having a single class with
an <code>UpdateSounds()</code> method that must be called from one thread and a
<code>RenderGraphics()</code> method that must be called from another is begging for
those kinds of bugs to happen.</p>
</aside>

<p>These two problems compound each other; the class touches so many domains that
every programmer will have to work on it, but it&#8217;s so huge that doing so is a
nightmare. If it gets bad enough, coders will start putting hacks in other parts
of the codebase just to stay out of the hairball that this <code>Bjorn</code> class has
become.</p>
<h3><a href="#cutting-the-knot" name="cutting-the-knot">Cutting the knot</a></h3>
<p>We can solve this like Alexander the Great&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;with a sword. We&#8217;ll take our
monolithic <code>Bjorn</code> class and slice it into separate parts along domain
boundaries. For example, we&#8217;ll take all of the code for handling user input and
move it into a separate <code>InputComponent</code> class. <code>Bjorn</code> will then own an
instance of this component. We&#8217;ll repeat this process for each of the domains that
<code>Bjorn</code> touches.</p>
<p>When we&#8217;re done, we&#8217;ll have moved almost everything out of <code>Bjorn</code>. All that
remains is a thin shell that binds the components together. We&#8217;ve solved our
huge class problem by simply dividing it up into multiple smaller classes, but
we&#8217;ve accomplished more than just that.</p>
<h3><a href="#loose-ends" name="loose-ends">Loose ends</a></h3>
<p>Our component classes are now decoupled. Even though <code>Bjorn</code> has a
<code>PhysicsComponent</code> and a <code>GraphicsComponent</code>, the two don&#8217;t know about each
other. This means the person working on physics can modify their component
without needing to know anything about graphics and vice versa.</p>
<p>In practice, the components will need to have <em>some</em> interaction between
themselves. For example, the AI component may need to tell the physics component
where Bj&oslash;rn is trying to go. However, we can restrict this to the
components that <em>do</em> need to talk instead of just tossing them all in the same
playpen together.</p>
<h3><a href="#tying-back-together" name="tying-back-together">Tying back together</a></h3>
<p>Another feature of this design is that the <span
name="inheritance">components</span> are now reusable packages. So far, we&#8217;ve
focused on our baker, but let&#8217;s consider a couple of other kinds of objects in
our game world. <em>Decorations</em> are things in the world the player sees but
doesn&#8217;t interact with: bushes, debris and other visual detail. <em>Props</em> are like
decorations but can be touched: boxes, boulders, and trees. <em>Zones</em> are the
opposite of decorations&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;invisible but interactive. They&#8217;re useful for things
like triggering a cutscene when Bj&oslash;rn enters an area.</p>
<aside name="inheritance">

<p>When object-oriented programming first hit the scene, inheritance was the
shiniest tool in its toolbox. It was considered the ultimate code-reuse hammer,
and coders swung it often. Since then, we&#8217;ve learned the hard way that it&#8217;s a
heavy hammer indeed. Inheritance has its uses, but it&#8217;s often too cumbersome for
simple code reuse.</p>
<p>Instead, the growing trend in software design is to use composition instead of
inheritance when possible. Instead of sharing code between two classes by having
them <em>inherit</em> from the same class, we do so by having them both <em>own an
instance</em> of the same class.</p>
</aside>

<p>Now, consider how we&#8217;d set up an inheritance hierarchy for those classes if we
weren&#8217;t using components. A first pass might look like:</p>
<p><img src="images/component-uml.png" alt="A class diagram. Zone has collision code and inherits from GameObject. Decoration also inherits from GameObject and has rendering code. Prop inherits from Zone but then has redundant rendering code." /></p>
<p>We have a base <code>GameObject</code> class that has common stuff like position and
orientation. <code>Zone</code> inherits from that and adds collision detection. Likewise,
<code>Decoration</code> inherits from <code>GameObject</code> and adds rendering. <code>Prop</code> inherits from
<code>Zone</code>, so it can reuse the collision code. However, <code>Prop</code> can&#8217;t <em>also</em> inherit
from <code>Decoration</code> to reuse the <em>rendering</em> code without running into the <span
name="diamond">Deadly Diamond</span>.</p>
<aside name="diamond">

<p>The &#8220;Deadly Diamond&#8221; occurs in class hierarchies with multiple inheritance where
there are two different paths to the same base class. The pain that causes is a
bit out of the scope of this book, but understand that they named it
&#8220;deadly&#8221; for a reason.</p>
</aside>

<p>We could flip things around so that <code>Prop</code> inherits from <code>Decoration</code>, but then
we end up having to duplicate the <em>collision</em> code. Either way, there&#8217;s no clean
way to reuse the collision and rendering code between the classes that need it
without resorting to multiple inheritance. The only other option is to push
everything up into <code>GameObject</code>, but then <code>Zone</code> is wasting memory on rendering
data it doesn&#8217;t need and <code>Decoration</code> is doing the same with physics.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s try it with components. Our <span name="menu">subclasses</span> disappear
completely. Instead, we have a single <code>GameObject</code> class and two component
classes: <code>PhysicsComponent</code> and <code>GraphicsComponent</code>. A decoration is simply a
<code>GameObject</code> with a <code>GraphicsComponent</code> but no <code>PhysicsComponent</code>. A zone is the
opposite, and a prop has both components. No code duplication, no multiple
inheritance, and only three classes instead of four.</p>
<aside name="menu">

<p>A restaurant menu is a good analogy. If each entity is a monolithic class, it&#8217;s
like you can only order combos. We need to have a separate class for each
possible <em>combination</em> of features. To satisfy every customer, we would need
dozens of combos.</p>
<p>Components are &agrave; la carte dining&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;each customer can select just the
dishes they want, and the menu is a list of the dishes they can choose
from.</p>
</aside>

<p>Components are basically plug-and-play for objects. They let us build complex
entities with rich behavior by plugging different reusable component
objects into sockets on the entity. Think software Voltron.</p>
<h2><a href="#the-pattern" name="the-pattern">The Pattern</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>single entity spans multiple domains</strong>. To keep the domains isolated, the
code for each is placed in its own <strong><span name="component">component</span>
class</strong>. The entity is reduced to a simple <strong>container of components</strong>.</p>
<aside name="component">

<p>&#8220;Component&#8221;, like &#8220;Object&#8221;, is one of those words that means everything and
nothing in programming. Because of that, it&#8217;s been used to describe a few
concepts. In business software, there&#8217;s a &#8220;Component&#8221; design pattern that
describes decoupled services that communicate over the web.</p>
<p>I tried to find a different name for this unrelated pattern found in games, but
&#8220;Component&#8221; seems to be the most common term for it. Since design patterns are
about documenting existing practices, I don&#8217;t have the luxury of coining a new
term. So, following in the footsteps of XNA, Delta3D, and others, &#8220;Component&#8221; it
is.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#when-to-use-it" name="when-to-use-it">When to Use It</a></h2>
<p>Components are most commonly found within the core class that defines the
entities in a game, but they may be useful in other places as well. This pattern can
be put to good use when any of these are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have a class that touches multiple domains which you want to keep
    decoupled from each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A class is getting massive and hard to work with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be able to define a variety of objects that share different
    capabilities, but using inheritance doesn&#8217;t let you pick the parts you
    want to reuse precisely enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#keep-in-mind" name="keep-in-mind">Keep in Mind</a></h2>
<p>The Component pattern adds a good bit of complexity over simply making a class and
putting code in it. Each conceptual &#8220;object&#8221; becomes a cluster of objects that
must be instantiated, initialized, and correctly wired together. Communication
between the different components becomes more challenging, and controlling how
they occupy memory is more complex.</p>
<p>For a large codebase, this complexity may be worth it for the decoupling and
code reuse it enables, but take care to ensure you aren&#8217;t over-engineering a
&#8220;solution&#8221; to a non-existent problem before applying this pattern.</p>
<p>Another consequence of using components is that you often have to hop through a
level of indirection to get anything done. Given the container object, first you
have to get the component you want, <em>then</em> you can do what you need. In <span
name="perf">performance</span>-critical inner loops, this pointer following may
lead to poor performance.</p>
<aside name="perf">

<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this coin. The Component pattern can often <em>improve</em>
performance and cache coherence. Components make it easier to use the <a
class="pattern" href="data-locality.html"> Data Locality</a> pattern to organize
your data in the order that the CPU wants it.</p>
</aside>

<h2><a href="#sample-code" name="sample-code">Sample Code</a></h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for me in writing this book is figuring out how to
isolate each pattern. Many design patterns exist to contain code that itself
isn&#8217;t part of the pattern. In order to distill the pattern down to its essence,
I try to cut as much of that out as possible, but at some point it becomes a bit
like explaining how to organize a closet without showing any clothes.</p>
<p>The Component pattern is a particularly hard one. You can&#8217;t get a real feel for
it without seeing some code for each of the domains that it decouples, so I&#8217;ll
have to sketch in a bit more of Bj&oslash;rn&#8217;s code than I&#8217;d like. The pattern is
really only the component <em>classes</em> themselves, but the code in them should
help clarify what the classes are for. It&#8217;s fake code&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it calls into other
classes that aren&#8217;t presented here&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;but it should give you an idea of what
we&#8217;re going for.</p>
<h3><a href="#a-monolithic-class" name="a-monolithic-class">A monolithic class</a></h3>
<p>To get a clearer picture of how this pattern is applied, we&#8217;ll start by showing
a monolithic <span name="cat"><code>Bjorn</code></span> class that does everything we need
but <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> use this pattern:</p>
<aside name="cat">

<p>I should point out that using the actual name of the character in the codebase
is usually a bad idea. The marketing department has an annoying habit of
demanding name changes days before you ship. &#8220;Focus tests show males between 11
and 15 respond negatively to &lsquo;Bj&oslash;rn&rsquo;. Use &lsquo;Sven&rsquo;
instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why many software projects use internal-only codenames. Well, that and
because it&#8217;s more fun to tell people you&#8217;re working on &#8220;Big Electric Cat&#8221; than
just &#8220;the next version of Photoshop.&#8221;</p>

<p>It reads the joystick to determine how to accelerate the baker. Then it resolves
its new position with the physics engine. Finally, it draws Bj&oslash;rn onto the
screen.</p>
<p>The sample implementation here is trivially simple. There&#8217;s no gravity,
animation, or any of the dozens of other details that make a character fun to
play. Even so, we can see that we&#8217;ve got a single function that several
different coders on our team will probably have to spend time in, and it&#8217;s
starting to get a bit messy. Imagine this scaled up to a thousand lines and you
can get an idea of how painful it can become.</p>
<h3><a href="#splitting-out-a-domain" name="splitting-out-a-domain">Splitting out a domain</a></h3>
<p>Starting with one domain, let&#8217;s pull a piece out of <code>Bjorn</code> and push it into a
separate component class. We&#8217;ll start with the first domain that gets processed:

<p><code>Bjorn</code> now owns an <code>InputComponent</code> object. Where before he was handling user
input directly in the <code>update()</code> method, now he delegates to the component:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">input_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We&#8217;ve only started, but already we&#8217;ve gotten rid of some coupling&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;the main
<code>Bjorn</code> class no longer has any reference to <code>Controller</code>. This will come in
handy later.</p>
<h3><a href="#splitting-out-the-rest" name="splitting-out-the-rest">Splitting out the rest</a></h3>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s go ahead and do the same cut-and-paste job on the physics and graphics
code. Here&#8217;s our new <code>PhysicsComponent</code>:</p>

<p>In addition to moving the physics <em>behavior</em> out of the main <code>Bjorn</code> class, you
can see we&#8217;ve also moved out the <em>data</em> too: The <code>Volume</code> object is now owned by
the component.</p>

<p>The <code>Bjorn</code> class now basically does two things: it holds the set of components
that actually define it, and it holds the state that is shared across multiple
domains. Position and velocity are still in the core <code>Bjorn</code> class for two
reasons. First, they are &#8220;pan-domain&#8221; state&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;almost every component will make
use of them, so it isn&#8217;t clear which component <em>should</em> own them if we did want
to push them down.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, it gives us an easy way for the components to
communicate without being coupled to each other. Let&#8217;s see if we can put that to
use.</p>
<h3><a href="#robo-bj&oslash;rn" name="robo-bj&oslash;rn">Robo-Bj&oslash;rn</a></h3>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve pushed our behavior out to separate component classes, but we
haven&#8217;t <em>abstracted</em> the behavior out. <code>Bjorn</code> still knows the exact concrete
classes where his behavior is defined. Let&#8217;s change that.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take our component for handling user input and hide it behind an
interface. We&#8217;ll turn <code>InputComponent</code> into an abstract base class:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">InputComponent</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">InputComponent</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">bjorn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then, we&#8217;ll take our existing user input handling code and push it down into a
class that implements that interface:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PlayerInputComponent</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">InputComponent</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">switch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Controller</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">getJoystickDirection</span><span class="p">())</span>

      <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">DIR_RIGHT</span>:
        <span class="n">bjorn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">velocity</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">WALK_ACCELERATION</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">WALK_ACCELERATION</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We&#8217;ll change <code>Bjorn</code> to hold a pointer to the input component instead of having
an inline instance:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bjorn</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">velocity</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">InputComponent</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">input_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{}</span>

  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">World</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Graphics</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">graphics</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">input_</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">physics_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">graphics_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">graphics</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="n">InputComponent</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">input_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">PhysicsComponent</span> <span class="n">physics_</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">GraphicsComponent</span> <span class="n">graphics_</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, when we instantiate <code>Bjorn</code>, we can pass in an input component for it to
use, like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">bjorn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">PlayerInputComponent</span><span class="p">());</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This instance can be any concrete type that implements our abstract
<code>InputComponent</code> interface. We pay a price for this&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;<code>update()</code> is now a virtual
method call, which is a little slower. What do we get in return for this cost?</p>
<p>Most consoles require a game to support &#8220;demo mode.&#8221; If the player sits at the
main menu without doing anything, the game will start playing automatically,
with the computer standing in for the player. This keeps the game from burning
the main menu into your TV and also makes the game look nicer when it&#8217;s running
on a kiosk in a store.</p>
<p>Hiding the input component class behind an interface lets us get that working.
We already have our concrete <code>PlayerInputComponent</code> that&#8217;s normally used when
playing the game. Now, let&#8217;s make another one:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DemoInputComponent</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">InputComponent</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">bjorn</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// AI to automatically control Bjorn...</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the game goes into demo mode, instead of constructing Bj&oslash;rn like we did
earlier, we&#8217;ll wire him up with our new component:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">bjorn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Bjorn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DemoInputComponent</span><span class="p">());</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And now, just by swapping out a component, we&#8217;ve got a fully functioning
computer-controlled player for demo mode. We&#8217;re able to reuse all of the other
code for Bj&oslash;rn&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;physics and graphics don&#8217;t even know there&#8217;s a difference.
Maybe I&#8217;m a bit strange, but it&#8217;s stuff like this that gets me up in the <span
name="coffee">morning</span>.</p>
<aside name="coffee">

<p>That, and coffee. Sweet, steaming hot coffee.</p>
</aside>

<h3><a href="#no-bj&oslash;rn-at-all" name="no-bj&oslash;rn-at-all">No Bj&oslash;rn at all?</a></h3>
<p>If you look at our <code>Bjorn</code> class now, you&#8217;ll notice there&#8217;s nothing really
&#8220;Bj&oslash;rn&#8221; about it&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it&#8217;s just a component bag. In fact, it looks like a pretty
good candidate for a base &#8220;game object&#8221; class that we can use for <em>every</em> object
in the game. All we need to do is pass in <em>all</em> the components, and we can build
any kind of object by picking and choosing parts like Dr. Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take our two remaining concrete components&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;physics and graphics&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;and
hide them behind interfaces like we did with input:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PhysicsComponent</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">PhysicsComponent</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameObject</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">world</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GraphicsComponent</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">GraphicsComponent</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GameObject</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Graphics</span><span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">graphics</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then we re-christen <code>Bjorn</code> into a <span name="id">generic</span> <code>GameObject</code>
class that uses those interfaces:</p>

<p>Some component systems take this even further. Instead of a <code>GameObject</code> that
contains its components, the game entity is just an ID, a number. Then, you
maintain separate collections of components where each one knows the ID of the
entity its attached to.</p>
<p>These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">entity component
systems</a> take decoupling
components to the extreme and let you add new components to an entity without
the entity even knowing. The <a href="data-locality.html" class="pattern">Data

<aside name="factory">

<p>This <code>createBjorn()</code> function is, of course, an example of the classic Gang of
Four <a class="gof-pattern" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FactoryMethod">Factory
Method</a> pattern.</p>
</aside>

<p>By defining other functions that instantiate <code>GameObjects</code> with different
components, we can create all of the different kinds of objects our game needs.</p>
<h2><a href="#design-decisions" name="design-decisions">Design Decisions</a></h2>
<p>The most important design question you&#8217;ll need to answer with this pattern is,
&#8220;What set of components do I need?&#8221; The answer there is going to depend on the
needs and genre of your game. The bigger and more complex your engine is, the
more finely you&#8217;ll likely want to slice your components.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a couple of more specific options to consider:</p>
<h3><a href="#how-does-the-object-get-its-components" name="how-does-the-object-get-its-components">How does the object get its components?</a></h3>
<p>Once we&#8217;ve split up our monolithic object into a few separate component parts,
we have to decide who puts the parts back together.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If the object creates its own components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It ensures that the object always has the components it needs.</em> You
    never have to worry about someone forgetting to wire up the right
    components to the object and breaking the game. The container object
    itself takes care of it for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s harder to reconfigure the object.</em> One of the powerful features of
    this pattern is that it lets you build new kinds of objects simply by
    recombining components. If our object always wires itself with the same
    set of hard-coded components, we aren&#8217;t taking advantage of that
    flexibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If outside code provides the components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The object becomes more flexible.</em> We can completely change the
    behavior of the object by giving it different components to work with.
    Taken to its fullest extent, our object becomes a generic component
    container that we can reuse over and over again for different purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The object can be decoupled from the concrete component types.</em> If
    we&#8217;re allowing outside code to pass in components, odds are good that
    we&#8217;re also letting it pass in <em>derived</em> component types. At that point,
    the object only knows about the component <em>interfaces</em> and not the
    concrete types themselves. This can make for a nicely encapsulated
    architecture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#how-do-components-communicate-with-each-other" name="how-do-components-communicate-with-each-other">How do components communicate with each other?</a></h3>
<p>Perfectly decoupled components that function in isolation is a nice ideal, but
it doesn&#8217;t really work in practice. The fact that these components are part of the
<em>same</em> object implies that they are part of a larger whole and need to
coordinate. That means communication.</p>
<p>So how can the components talk to each other? There are a couple of options, but
unlike most design &#8220;alternatives&#8221; in this book, these aren&#8217;t exclusive&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you will
likely support more than one at the same time in your designs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>By modifying the container object&#8217;s state:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It keeps the components decoupled.</em> When our <code>InputComponent</code> set
    Bj&oslash;rn&#8217;s velocity and the <code>PhysicsComponent</code> later used it, the two
    components had no idea that the other even existed. For all they knew,
    Bj&oslash;rn&#8217;s velocity could have changed through black magic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It requires any information that components need to share to get pushed
    up into the container object.</em> Often, there&#8217;s state that&#8217;s really only
    needed by a subset of the components. For example, an animation and a
    rendering component may need to share information that&#8217;s
    graphics-specific. Pushing that information up into the container object
    where <em>every</em> component can get to it muddies the object class.</p>
<p>Worse, if we use the same container object class with different
component configurations, we can end up wasting memory on state that
isn&#8217;t needed by <em>any</em> of the object&#8217;s components. If we push some
rendering-specific data into the container object, any invisible object
will be burning memory on it with no benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It makes communication implicit and dependent on the order that
    components are processed.</em> In our sample code, the original monolithic
    <code>update()</code> method had a very carefully laid out order of operations. The
    user input modified the velocity, which was then used by the physics
    code to modify the position, which in turn was used by the rendering
    code to draw Bj&oslash;rn at the right spot. When we split that code out into
    components, we were careful to preserve that order of operations.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#8217;t, we would have introduced <span name="pure">subtle</span>,
hard-to-track bugs. For example, if we&#8217;d updated the graphics component
<em>first</em>, we would wrongly render Bj&oslash;rn at his position on the <em>last</em>
frame, not this one. If you imagine several more components and lots
more code, then you can get an idea of how hard it can be to avoid bugs
like this.</p>
<aside name="pure">

<p>Shared mutable state like this where lots of code is reading and writing
the same data is notoriously hard to get right. That&#8217;s a big part of why
academics are spending time researching pure functional languages like
Haskell where there is no mutable state at all.</p>
</aside>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By referring directly to each other:</strong></p>
<p>The idea here is that components that need to talk will have direct
references to each other without having to go through the container
object at all.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to let Bj&oslash;rn jump. The graphics code needs to know if
he should be drawn using a jump sprite or not. It can determine this by
asking the physics engine if he&#8217;s currently on the ground. An easy way
to do this is by letting the graphics component know about the physics
component directly:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>When we construct Bj&oslash;rn&#8217;s <code>GraphicsComponent</code>, we&#8217;ll give it a reference
to his corresponding <code>PhysicsComponent</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>It&#8217;s simple and fast.</em> Communication is a direct method call from one
    object to another. The component can call any method that is supported
    by the component it has a reference to. It&#8217;s a free-for-all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The two components are tightly coupled.</em> The downside of the
    free-for-all. We&#8217;ve basically taken a step back towards our monolithic
    class. It&#8217;s not quite as bad as the original single class though, since
    we&#8217;re at least restricting the coupling to only the component pairs that
    need to interact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By sending messages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is the most complex alternative. We can actually build a little
    messaging system into our container object and let the components
    broadcast information to each other.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one possible implementation. We&#8217;ll start by defining a base
<code>Component</code> interface that all of our components will implement:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Component</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="n">Component</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
  <span class="k">virtual</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has a single <code>receive()</code> method that component classes implement in
order to listen to an incoming message. Here, we&#8217;re just using an <code>int</code>
to identify the message, but a fuller implementation could attach
additional data to the message.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll add a method to our container object for sending messages:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ContainerObject</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">public:</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">MAX_COMPONENTS</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">components_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">components_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nl">private:</span>
  <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">MAX_COMPONENTS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">Component</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">components_</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">MAX_COMPONENTS</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p><span name="queue">Now</span>, if a component has access to its
container, it can send messages to the container, which will
rebroadcast the message to all of the contained components. (That
inclues the original component that sent the message; be careful that
you don&#8217;t get stuck in a feedback loop!) This has a couple of
consequences:</p>
<aside name="queue">

<p>If you really want to get fancy, you can even make this message system
<em>queue</em> messages to be delivered later. For more on this, see <a
href="event-queue.html" class="pattern">Event Queue</a>.</p>
</aside>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sibling components are decoupled.</em> By going <span
    name="mediator">through</span> the parent container object, like our
    shared state alternative, we ensure that the components are still
    decoupled from each other. With this system, the only coupling they have
    is the message values themselves.</p>
<aside name="mediator">

<p>The Gang of Four call this the <a class="gof-pattern"
href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?MediatorPattern">Mediator</a> pattern &#8212;
two or more objects communicate with each other indirectly by routing
the message through an intermediate object. In this case, the container
object itself is the mediator.</p>
</aside>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>The container object is simple.</em> Unlike using shared state where the
    container object itself owns and knows about data used by the
    components, here, all it does is blindly pass the messages along. That
    can be useful for letting two components pass very domain-specific
    information between themselves without having that bleed into the
    container object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there&#8217;s no one best answer here. What you&#8217;ll likely end up doing
is using a bit of all of them. Shared state is useful for the really basic stuff
that you can take for granted that every object has&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;things like position and
size.</p>
<p>Some domains are distinct but still closely related. Think animation and
rendering, user input and AI, or physics and collision. If you have separate
components for each half of those pairs, you may find it easiest to just let
them know directly about their other half.</p>
<p>Messaging is useful for &#8220;less important&#8221; communication. Its fire-and-forget
nature is a good fit for things like having an audio component play a sound when
a physics component sends a message that the object has collided with something.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend you start simple and then add in additional
communication paths if you need them.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> framework&#8217;s core <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/GameObjects.html"><code>GameObject</code></a> class is designed

</li>
<li>
<p>The open source <a href="http://www.delta3d.org">Delta3D</a> engine has a base

<li>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/">XNA</a> game framework
    comes with a core <code>Game</code> class. It owns a collection of <code>GameComponent</code>
    objects. Where our example uses components at the individual game entity
    level, XNA implements the pattern at the level of the main game object
    itself, but the purpose is the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This pattern bears resemblance to the Gang of Four&#8217;s <a class="gof-pattern"
    href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?StrategyPattern">Strategy</a> pattern. Both
    patterns are about taking part of an object&#8217;s behavior and delegating it to
    a separate subordinate object. The difference is that with the Strategy
    pattern, the separate &#8220;strategy&#8221; object is usually stateless&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;it
    encapsulates an algorithm, but no data. It defines <em>how</em> an object behaves,
    but not <em>what</em> it is.</p>
<p>Components are a bit more self-important. They often hold state that
describes the object and helps define its actual identity. However, the line
may blur. You may have some components that don&#8217;t need any local state. In
that case, you&#8217;re free to use the same component <em>instance</em> across multiple
container objects. At that point, it really is behaving more akin to a
strategy.</p>
