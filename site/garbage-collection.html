<p><strong>todo: figure out what illustrations to add</strong></p>
<p><strong>todo: subheaders?</strong></p>
<p>A language like Lox is &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; because it frees programmers from having to
worry about details that are too mundane or irrelevant to what they are trying
to accomplish. The user becomes an executive giving the machine abstract
goals and letting the lowly computer figure how to get there.</p>
<p>Dynamic memory allocation is a perfect candidate for automation. It&rsquo;s necessary
for a working program, typically tedious to do by hand, and yet still
error-prone. When errors do happen, it can be catastrophic, leading to crashes,
memory corruption or security violations. It&rsquo;s the kind of risky-yet-boring work
that machines excel at over humans.</p>
<p>This is why Lox is a &ldquo;managed&rdquo; language, which means that the language
implementation manages memory allocation on the user&rsquo;s behalf. The way this
works is that any time a user performs an operation that requires some dynamic
memory, the allocation is done automatically and implicitly. Whenever they need
some memory, it&rsquo;s handed out. They never worry about deallocating anything. As
long as they are using a piece of memory, the machine ensures that memory is
still there.</p>
<p>Lox provides the illusion that the computer has an infinite amount of memory.
Users can allocate and allocate and allocate and never once think about where
all these bytes are coming from. Of course, computers do not yet <em>have</em> infinite
memory. So the way managed languages maintain this illusion is by going behind
the programmer&rsquo;s back and reclaiming memory that the program no longer needs.
The component that does this is called a <strong>garbage <span
name="recycle">collector</span></strong>.</p>
<aside name="recycle">
<p>Recycling would really be a better metaphor for this. The GC doesn&rsquo;t <em>throw
away</em> the memory, it frees it up so it can be reused for new data in the future.
But managed languages have been around since before Earth Day was started, so
they went with the similies they had at hand.</p>
</aside>
<h3><a href="#reachability" name="reachability"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;0&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Reachability</a></h3>
<p>This raises a surprisingly difficult question: how does a VM tell what memory
isn&rsquo;t needed? Memory can only be needed if it will be read from in the future,
but short of having a time machine, how can an implementation tell what code the
program <em>will</em> execute and which data it will read? Spoiler alert: VMs cannot
travel into the future. Instead, the language makes a <span
name="conservative">conservative</span> approximation: it considers a piece of
memory to still be in use if it <em>could possibly</em> be read in the future.</p>
<aside name="conservative">
<p>I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in the general sense. There is such a thing as
&ldquo;conservative garbage collector&rdquo; which means something more specific that what
I&rsquo;m talking about here. All garbage collectors are &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in that they
keep memory alive if it <em>could</em> be accessed instead of having a Magic 8-Ball
that lets them more precisely know what data <em>will</em> be accessed.</p>
<p>A <strong>conservative GC</strong> is a special kind of collector that considers any piece of
memory to be a pointer if the value in there looks like it could be an address.
This is in contrast to a <strong>precise GC</strong><span class="em">&mdash;</span>which is what we&rsquo;ll implement<span class="em">&mdash;</span>that
knows exactly which words in memory are pointers and which store other kinds of
values like numbers or strings.</p>
</aside>
<p>That seems really conservative. Couldn&rsquo;t <em>any</em> bit of memory possibly be read?
Actually, no. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;first value&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;updated&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Pause this program right after the assignment has completed on the second line.
We want to run the GC to reclaim any memory we can right then. The string &ldquo;first
value&rdquo; is still sitting in memory, but there is no way for the user&rsquo;s program to
ever get to it. Once <code>a</code> got reassigned, the program lost its reference to that
string. It is unreachable and we can safely free it. A value is <strong>reachable</strong> if
there is some way for a user program to reference it.</p>
<p>Many values can be directly accessed by the VM. Take a look at:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">global</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;string&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">local</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;another&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">global</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Pause the program right after the two strings have been concatenated but before
the print statement has executed. The VM can reach <code>"string"</code> by looking through
the global variable table and finding the entry for <code>global</code>. It can find
<code>"another"</code> by walking its value stack and hitting the slot for the local
variable <code>local</code>. It can even find the concatenated string <code>"stringanother"</code>
since that temporary value is also sitting on the stack at the point when we
paused our program.</p>
<p>All of these values are called <strong>roots</strong>. A root is any object that can be
reached directly without going through some other object. Most roots are global
variables or on the stack, but as we&rsquo;ll see, there are a couple of other places
the VM stores references to objects that it can find. Since the user&rsquo;s program
could possibly read from those variables or stack slots, all roots are
considered live and need to be kept around.</p>
<p><strong>todo: is the above correct? where?</strong></p>
<p>Other values aren&rsquo;t directly reachable, but can still be accessed by going
through a reference inside some other value. Fields on instances of classes are
the most obvious case, but we don&rsquo;t have those <span name="class">yet</span>.
Even without those, our VM still has indirect references. Consider:</p>
<aside name="class">
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there <a href="classes-and-instances.html">soon</a>, though!</p>
</aside>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">makeClosure</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;data&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">var</span> <span class="n">closure</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">makeClosure</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="c1">// Pause here.</span>
<span class="n">closure</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Say we pause the program on the marked line and run the garbage collector. When
the collector is done and the program resumes, it will call the closure, which
will in turn print <code>"data"</code>. So the collector needs to <em>not</em> free that string.
But here&rsquo;s what the stack looks like when we paused the program:</p>
<p><strong>todo: illustrate</strong></p>
<p>The <code>"data"</code> string is nowhere on it. It has already been hoisted off the stack
and moved into the closed upvalue that the closure uses. The closure itself is
on the stack. But to get to the string, we need to trace through the closure
and its upvalue array to reach it. Since it <em>is</em> possible for the user&rsquo;s
program to do that, all of these indirectly accessible objects are also
considered reachable.</p>
<p><strong>todo: show path through closure to string</strong></p>
<p>This gives us a simple recursive definition of which objects are reachable:</p>
<ul>
<li>All roots are reachable.</li>
<li>Any object referred to from a reachable object is itself reachable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the values that are still &ldquo;live&rdquo; and need to stay in memory. Any value
that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> meet this definition is fair game for the collector to reap.
That recursive pair of rules hints at a recursive algorithm we can use to free
up unneeded memory:</p>
<ol>
<li>At a <span name="suitable">suitable</span> time, run a garbage collection.</li>
<li>Starting with the roots, traverse through object references to find the
    full set of reachable objects.</li>
<li>Free any objects not in that set.</li>
</ol>
<p><span name="suitable"></p>
<p>Later, we&rsquo;ll get into what a &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; time to collect is. This came as a
surprise to me, but that turns out to be one of the more difficult, subtle
questions to answer when designing a GC.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p>A number of very <span name="handbook">different</span> garbage collection
algorithms are in use today, but they all roughly follow that same structure.
Some may interleave the steps or mix them, but those three fundamental
operations are there. They mostly differ in <em>how</em> they perform each step.</p>
<aside name="handbook">
<p>Since this book is a guided tour and not a broad survey, we&rsquo;re going to pick a
single algorithm and stick with it. The two most common other algorithms are
<strong>reference counting</strong> (usually shortened to <strong>ref counting</strong>) and <strong>copying
collection</strong>. If you want a deep dive on those and most of the other strategies,
<a href="http://gchandbook.org/">&ldquo;The Garbage Collection Handbook&rdquo;</a> is the canonical reference. For a
large book on such a deep, narrow topic, it is quite enjoyable to read.</p>
</aside>
<h2><a href="#mark-sweep-garbage-collection" name="mark-sweep-garbage-collection"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Mark-Sweep Garbage Collection</a></h2>
<p>The first language to not require programmers to explicitly free memory was
Lisp, the second &ldquo;high level&rdquo; language right after Fortran. John McCarthy
considered manual memory management and reference counting, but <span
name="procrastination">eventually</span> settled on (and coined) garbage
collection<span class="em">&mdash;</span>once the program was out of memory it would go back and find
unused storage it could reclaim.</p>
<aside name="procrastination">
<p>In John McCarthy&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Lisp&rdquo;, he notes: &ldquo;Once we decided on garbage
collection, its actual implementation could be postponed, because only toy
examples were being done.&rdquo; So our procrastination on adding a GC to clox has a
luminous legacy.</p>
</aside>
<p>He designed the very first, simplest garbage collection algorithm, called
<strong>mark-and-sweep</strong> or just <strong>mark-sweep</strong>. Its description fits in three short
paragraphs in the initial paper on Lisp. Despite its age and simplicity, the
same fundamental algorithm underlies many modern memory managers. Some corners
of CS seem to be timeless.</p>
<p>As the name implies, it works in two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Marking.</strong> In the first phase, we start with the root values and traverse
    or <span name="trace"><em>trace</em></span> through all of the value those roots
    refer to. This is a classic graph traversal of all of the reachable objects.
    Each time we visit an object, we <em>mark</em> it in some way. (Implementations
    differ in how they record the mark.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sweeping.</strong> Once the mark phase has completed every reachable object in
    the heap has been marked. That means any unmarked object is unreachable and
    ripe for reclamation. We go through them all and free each one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>todo: illustrate phases</strong></p>
<aside name="trace">
<p>A <strong>tracing garbage collector</strong> is any algorithm that traces through the graph
of object references. This is in contrast with reference counting and copying
collectors which have different strategies for tracking and visiting the
reachable objects.</p>
</aside>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do. Whenever we decide it&rsquo;s time to reap some bytes,
we&rsquo;ll trace everything and mark all the reachable objects, free what&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t
get marked, and then resume the user&rsquo;s program.</p>
<h2><a href="#collecting-garbage" name="collecting-garbage"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Collecting Garbage</a></h2>
<p>This entire chapter is about implementing one <span name="one">function</span>:</p>
<aside name="one">
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s going to end up getting a bunch of helper functions too.</p>

</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.h</em>, add after <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>We&rsquo;ll work our way up to a full implementation starting with this empty shell:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>
add after <em>freeObject</em>()</div>
<pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">collectGarbage</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>                      
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, add after <em>freeObject</em>()</div>

<p>The first question you might ask is, &ldquo;When does this function get called?&rdquo; It
turns out that&rsquo;s subtle question that we&rsquo;ll spend some time on later in the
chapter. For now we&rsquo;re going to sidestep the issue and build ourselves a handy
diagnostic tool in the process:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#define DEBUG_TRACE_EXECUTION      </span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>common.h</em></div>
<pre class="insert"><br><span></span><span class="cp">#define DEBUG_STRESS_GC            </span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span><span class="cp">#define UINT8_COUNT (UINT8_MAX + 1)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>common.h</em></div>

<p>We&rsquo;ll add an optional &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; mode for the garbage collector. When this
flag is defined, the GC runs as often as it possibly can. This is, obviously,
horrendous for performance. But it&rsquo;s great for flushing out memory management
bugs that only occur when a GC is triggered at just the right moment. If <em>every</em>
moment triggers a GC, you&rsquo;re bound to hit it.</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>Here, whenever we call <code>reallocate()</code> to acquire more memory, we force a full
collection to run. The if check is because <code>reallocate()</code> is also called to free
or shrink an allocation. We don&rsquo;t want to trigger a GC for that<span class="em">&mdash;</span>in particular
because the GC itself will call <code>reallocate()</code> to free memory.</p>
<p>Checking to begin a collection during <span name="demand">allocation</span> is
the classic way to wire the GC into the VM. It makes sense for a couple of
reasons. You&rsquo;re already calling into the memory manager to get some bytes, so
it&rsquo;s an easy place to hook in the code. Also, allocation is the only time when
you really <em>need</em> to free up some memory, so that you can then reuse it. If you
<em>don&rsquo;t</em> use allocation to trigger a GC, you have to make sure every possible
place in code where you can loop and allocate memory also has a way to trigger
the collector. Otherwise, the VM can get into a state where it needs more memory
but it never reclaims any.</p>
<aside name="demand">
<p>More sophisticated collectors might run on a separate thread, or interleaved
periodically during program execution, before function calls, or even when a
backwards jump occurs.</p>

<h3><a href="#debug-logging" name="debug-logging"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;2&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Debug logging</a></h3>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of diagnostics, let&rsquo;s put some more in there. One of
the real challenges I&rsquo;ve found with garbage collectors is that they are opaque.
We&rsquo;ve been running lots of Lox programs just fine without any GC at all so far.
Once we add one, how do we tell if it&rsquo;s doing anything useful? Can we only tell
if we write programs that plow through acres of memory? How do we debug that?</p>
<p>An easy way to shine a light on the GC&rsquo;s inner workings is with some logging.
We&rsquo;ll add another flag:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#define DEBUG_STRESS_GC            </span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>common.h</em></div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span><span class="cp">#define DEBUG_LOG_GC               </span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span><span class="cp">#define UINT8_COUNT (UINT8_MAX + 1)</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>common.h</em></div>

<p>When this is enabled, clox will print some information to the console whenever
it does anything interesting with dynamic memory. We need a couple of includes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;vm.h&quot;                                                   </span><span class="cp"></span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em></div>
<pre class="insert"><br><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC                                               </span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;                                                </span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;debug.h&quot;                                                </span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#endif                                                            </span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">reallocate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">previous</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">oldSize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">newSize</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em></div>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have a collector yet, but we can start putting in some of the logging
now. We&rsquo;ll want to know when a GC fires off:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">collectGarbage</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>   
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>

<pre class="insert"><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC       </span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;-- gc begin</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cp">#endif                    </span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span><span class="p">}</span>                         
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">freeObjects</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>      
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>collectGarbage</em>()</div>

<p>Eventually we will log some other operations during the collection, so we&rsquo;ll
also want to know when the show&rsquo;s over:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;-- gc begin</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="cp">#endif                    </span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>
in <em>collectGarbage</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><br><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC       </span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;-- gc end</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>  
<span class="cp">#endif                    </span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span><span class="p">}</span>                         
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>collectGarbage</em>()</div>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have any code for the collector yet, but we do have code for allocating
and freeing, so we can instrument those now:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">objects</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">;</span>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>object.c</em>, in <em>allocateObject</em>()</div>

<p>And at the end of an object&rsquo;s lifespan:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>freeObject</em>()</div>

<p>Now with these two flags, we should be able to tell if we&rsquo;re making progress as
we work through the rest of the chapter.</p>
<h2><a href="#marking-the-roots" name="marking-the-roots"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;3</small> Marking the Roots</a></h2>
<p>Objects are scattered across the heap like stars in the inky night sky. A
reference from one object to another forms a connection and these constellations
are the graph that the mark phase will traverse. Marking begins at the roots<span class="em">&mdash;</span>the set of objects can find VM directly without going through another object:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC       </span>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, add after <em>freeObject</em>()</div>

<p>To mark a Lox value, we use this new function:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.h</em>, add after <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>Some Lox values<span class="em">&mdash;</span>numbers, Booleans, and <code>nil</code><span class="em">&mdash;</span>are stored directly inline
and require no heap allocation. The garbage collector doesn&rsquo;t need to worry
them at all, so the first thing we do is check to see if the value is an actual
heap object. If so, the real work happens in this function:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.h</em>, add after <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>Which is defined here:</p>

<p>This <code>NULL</code> check is unnecessary when called from <code>markValue()</code>. A Value that is
some kind of Lox Obj type will always have a valid pointer. But later we will
call this function directly from other code and in some of those cases, the
object being pointed to is optional.</p>
<p>Assuming we do have a valid object, we mark it by setting a flag right on the
object. That new field lives in the Obj header struct all objects share:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">ObjType</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="p">;</span>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>object.h</em>, in struct <em>sObj</em></div>

<p>Every new object begins life unmarked because we haven&rsquo;t determined if it is

<p>Marking the stack covers local variables. The other main source of roots are

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>markRoots</em>()</div>

<p>Those live in a hash table owned by the VM, so we&rsquo;ll declare another helper

<p>Pretty straightforward. We walk the entry array and mark every key string and
value, uh, value.</p>
<p>Those cover the roots that we typically think of<span class="em">&mdash;</span>the values that are
obviously reachable because they&rsquo;re stored in variables that are directly
accessible to the user&rsquo;s program. But the VM has a few of its own nooks and
crannies where it squirrels away references to values that it directly accesses.</p>
<p>Most data lives in the VM&rsquo;s value stack, but it maintains a separate stack of
CallFrames. Each CallFrame contains a pointer to the closure being called. The
VM uses those pointers to access constants and upvalues, so those closures need
to be kept around too:</p>

<p>Remember, a collection can begin during <em>any</em> allocation. Those allocations
don&rsquo;t just happen while the user&rsquo;s program is running. The compiler itself
periodically grabs memory for the heap for things like constants and the
constant table. If the GC runs while we&rsquo;re in the middle of compiling, then any
values the compiler directly accesses need to be treated as roots too.</p>
<p>To keep the compiler module more cleanly separated from the rest of the VM,
we&rsquo;ll do that in a separate function:</p>

<p>Fortunately, the compiler doesn&rsquo;t have too many values that it hangs onto so our
task is simple. The only object it uses is the ObjFunction that it is compiling
into. Since function declarations can nest, the compiler has a linked list of
those and we walk the whole list.</p>
<p>Since the &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; module is calling <code>markObject()</code>, it also needs an include:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;compiler.h&quot;</span><span class="cp"></span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>compiler.c</em></div>

</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>compiler.c</em></div>

<p>Those are the roots. After running this, every object that the VM<span class="em">&mdash;</span>runtime and
compiler<span class="em">&mdash;</span>can get to without going through some other object will have its
mark bit set.</p>
<h2><a href="#tracing-object-references" name="tracing-object-references"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;4</small> Tracing Object References</a></h2>
<p>The next step in the marking process is tracing through the graph of object
references from the roots to find every other indirectly reachable object. We
don&rsquo;t have instances with fields yet, so there aren&rsquo;t many objects that contain
references, but we do have <span name="some">some</span>. In particular,
ObjClosure has the list of ObjUpvalues it closes over as well as a reference to
the raw ObjFunction that it wraps. ObjFunction in turn has a constant table
containing references to all of the constants contained in the function&rsquo;s body.
This is enough to build fairly complex webs of objects for our collector to
crawl through.</p>
<aside name="some">
<p>I slotted this chapter into the book right here specifically <em>because</em> now that
we have closures, we finally have some objects that contain interesting
references to other objects.</p>
</aside>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to implement that traversal. We can go breadth-first, depth-first,
or some other order. Since we just need to find the <em>set</em> of all reachable
objects, the order we visit them <span name="dfs">mostly</span> doesn&rsquo;t matter.
In our GC, we&rsquo;ll use depth-first because it&rsquo;s a little simpler to implement a
stack than a queue.</p>
<aside name="dfs">
<p>I say &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; because some garbage collectors copy or move objects in the order
they are visited. That means the traversal order determines which objects end up
adjacent in memory. That in turn can have a large impact on performance because
the CPU uses locality to determine which memory to preload into the caches.</p>
<p>Even when it does matter, it&rsquo;s not clear which order is <em>best</em>. It&rsquo;s very
difficult to determine which order objects will be used in the future, so it&rsquo;s
hard for the GC to know which order will help performance.</p>
</aside>
<h3><a href="#tri-color-abstraction" name="tri-color-abstraction"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;4&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Tri-color abstraction</a></h3>
<p>Whichever algorithm we choose, the important part is to make sure we don&rsquo;t lose
track of where we are while in the middle of the traversal. It&rsquo;s less of a
concern for our GC since we do the entire marking process in one monolithic
step. More advanced implementations like incremental collectors interleave the
marking phase with running pieces of the user&rsquo;s program which means the
collector needs to be able to pause and then pick up where it left off later.</p>
<p>To help us soft-brained humans reason about this complex process, GC designers
came up with a metaphor called the <span name="color"></span><strong>tri-color
abstraction</strong>. Each object has a color that helps keep track of what state the
object is in and what work is left to do.</p>
<aside name="color">
<p>Different garbage collection algorithms often add other colors to the
abstraction. I&rsquo;ve seen multiple shades of gray and even purple in some designs.
Feel free to choose your own colors if you&rsquo;re feeling fancy.</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>White</strong> &ndash; At the beginning of a garbage collection, every object is
    white. This color means we have not reached or processed the object at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gray</strong> &ndash; During marking, when we first reach an object, it gets
    darked to gray. This color means we know it is reachable and should not be
    collected. But we have not yet traced <em>through</em> it to see what other objects
    it references.</p>
<p>In graph algorithm terms, this is the <em>worklist</em>. The set of objects we
know about but haven&rsquo;t processed yet. In a depth-first search, this is a
stack. In breadth-first, it&rsquo;s a queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Black</strong> &ndash; When we take a gray object and traverse and mark all of
    the object it references, we then turn it black. This color means the mark
    phase is completely done with the object and doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about it
    anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of that abstraction, the marking process now looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start off with all objects white.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find all the roots and mark them gray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As long as there are still gray objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a gray object. Look at each other object it references. If the
    referenced object is white, mark it gray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark the original gray object black.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>todo: make this a flowchart?</strong></p>
<p>I find it helps to visualize this. You have a web of objects with references
between them. Initially, they are all little white dots. Off to the side are
some incoming edges from the VM that point to the roots. Those turn gray. Then
each gray object&rsquo;s siblings turn gray while the object itself turns black. The
full effect is a gray wavefront that passes through the graph, leaving a field
of reachable black objects behind it. Any unreachable object is not touched by
this wavefront and stays white.</p>
<p>At the end, you&rsquo;re left with a sea of reached black objects sprinkled with
islands of white objects that can be swept up and freed. Once those are freed,
the remaining objects<span class="em">&mdash;</span>all black<span class="em">&mdash;</span>are reset to white for the next garbage
collection cycle.</p>
<p><strong>todo: illustrate</strong></p>
<p>In our implementation we have already marked the roots. They&rsquo;re all gray. The
next step is to start picking them and traversing their references. But we don&rsquo;t
have any easy way to find them. We set a field on the object, but that&rsquo;s it. We
don&rsquo;t want to have to traverse the entire object list looking for objects with
that field set.</p>
<p>Instead, we&rsquo;ll create a separate worklist to keep track of all of the gray
objects. When an object turns gray, we&rsquo;ll set that field and also add it to the
worklist:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>markObject</em>()</div>

<p>We could use any kind of data structure that lets us put items in and take them
out easily. I picked a stack because that&rsquo;s the simplest to implement with a
dynamic array in C. It works mostly like other dynamic arrays we&rsquo;ve built in
Lox, <em>except</em> note that it calls the <em>system</em> <code>realloc()</code> function and not our
own <code>reallocate()</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>The memory for the gray stack itself is <em>not</em> managed by the garbage collector.
We don&rsquo;t want growing the gray stack in the middle of a GC to cause the GC to
try to recursively invoke itself. It could tear a hole in the space-time
continuum. So we&rsquo;ll manage its memory ourselves, explicitly.</p>
<p>The VM owns the gray stack:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as close to that flowchart as you can get. Until the stack empties out, we
keep pulling out gray objects, traversing their references, and them marking
them black. Traversing an objects references will likely turn up new white
objects that get marked gray and added to the stack. So this function swings
back and forth between turning white objects gray and gray objects black,
gradually advancing the entire wavefront forward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where we traverse a single object&rsquo;s references:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, add after <em>markValue</em>()</div>

<p>Each <span name="leaf">kind</span> of object has its own fields that might
reference other objects, so we need a specific blob of code for each object
kind. We start here with the easy ones<span class="em">&mdash;</span>strings and native function objects
contain no outgoing references so there is nothing to traverse.</p>
<aside name="leaf">
<p>An easy optimization we could do in <code>markObject()</code> is to skip not bother adding
objects of these kinds to the gray stack at all since we know they don&rsquo;t need to
be processed. Instead, they can darken from white straight to black.</p>
</aside>
<p>Note that we don&rsquo;t set any state in the traversed object itself. There is no
direct encoding of &ldquo;black&rdquo; in the object&rsquo;s state. A black object is any object
whose <code>isMarked</code> field is <span name="field">set</span> and is no longer in the
gray stack.</p>
<aside name="field">
<p>You may rightly wonder why we have the <code>isMarked</code> field at all. All in good
time, friend.</p>
</aside>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s start adding in the other object types. The simplest is upvalues:</p>

<p>When an upvalue is closed, it contains a reference to the closed-over value.
Since the value is no longer on the stack, we need to make sure we trace the
reference to it from the upvalue.</p>

other objects. We trace all of those using this helper:</p>

<p>It marks every value in the array, which will in turn add them to the gray

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>blackenObject</em>()</div>

<p>Each closure has a reference to the bare function it wraps, as well as an array
of pointers to the upvalues it captured. That&rsquo;s the basics, but there are two
loose ends to tie off. First, a little logging:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">blackenObject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Obj</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>

<pre class="insert"><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC                     </span>
  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%p blacken &quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">);</span>        
  <span class="n">printValue</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OBJ_VAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">));</span>

</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>blackenObject</em>()</div>

<p>This way, we can watch the tracing percolate through the object graph. Speaking
of which, note that I said <em>graph</em>. References between objects are directed, but
that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re <em>acyclic</em>! It&rsquo;s entirely possible to have cycles of
objects. When that happens, we need to ensure our collector doesn&rsquo;t get stuck in
an infinite loop as it spins through continually re-adding the same series of
objects to the gray stack.</p>
<p>The fix is easy:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>  
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>
in <em>markObject</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">isMarked</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
<br></pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG_LOG_GC            </span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>markObject</em>()</div>

<p>If the object is already marked, we don&rsquo;t need to mark it again and shouldn&rsquo;t
add it to the gray stack. This ensures that an already-gray object is not
redundantly added and that a black object is not inadvertently turned back to
gray. In other words, it keeps the wavefront moving forward through the white
objects.</p>
<h2><a href="#sweeping-unused-objects" name="sweeping-unused-objects"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;5</small> Sweeping Unused Objects</a></h2>
<p>When the loop in <code>traceReferences()</code> exits, we have processed every single
object we could get our hands on. The gray stack is empty and every object is
either black or white. The black objects are reachable and we want to hang on
to them. Anything still white never got touched by the trace and is thus
garbage. All that&rsquo;s left is to reclaim them:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">traceReferences</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, add after <em>traceReferences</em>()</div>

<p>I know that&rsquo;s kind of a lot of code and pointer shenanigans but there isn&rsquo;t much
to it once you work through it. The outer while loop walks the linked list of
every single object we have allocated. It checks the mark bit of each object. If
the object is not marked, it unlinks it from the list and then frees it using
the <code>freeObject()</code> we already wrote.</p>
<p>Most of the other code in here deals with the fact that removing a node from a
singly-linked list is kind of cumbersome. We have to continously remember the
previous node so we can unlink its next pointer, and we have to handle the edge
case where we are freeing the first node. But, otherwise, it&rsquo;s pretty simple:
delete every node in a linked list that doesn&rsquo;t have a bit set in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one little addition:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">isMarked</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>    
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>memory.c</em><br>
in <em>sweep</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>      <span class="n">object</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">isMarked</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span>      <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">;</span>       
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>sweep</em>()</div>

<p>After <code>sweep()</code> completes, the only remaining objects will be the live black
ones with their mark bits set. That&rsquo;s correct, but when the next collection
cycle starts, we need every object to be white. So whenever we reach a black
object, we go ahead and clear the bit now in anticipation of the next run.</p>
<p>We are almost done. There is one remaining corner of the VM that has some
unusual requirements around memory. Recall that when we added strings to clox we
made the VM intern them all. That means the VM has a hash table containing a
pointer to every single string in the heap. This way when we need a new string,
the VM can see if there is already a string with those same characters that it
can reuse in order to avoid duplicate strings.</p>
<p>We deliberately did <em>not</em> treat the VM&rsquo;s string table as a set of roots. If we
had, no <span name="intern">string</span> would <em>ever</em> be collected. The string
table would grow and grow and never yield a single byte of memory back to the
operating system. That would be bad.</p>
<aside name="intern">
<p>This can be a real problem. Java does not intern all strings, but it does
intern string literals and also provides an API to let users explicitly add
strings to the string table. For many years, the capacity of that table was
fixed and strings added to it could never be removed. If users weren&rsquo;t careful
about their use of <code>String.intern()</code>, they could inadvertently run out of
memory and take down their application.</p>
<p>Ruby had a similar problem for years where symbols were not garbage collected.
Both languages (well, their implementations) eventually allowed the GC to
collect these strings.</p>

<p>At the same time, if we <em>do</em> let the GC free strings, then the VM&rsquo;s string
table will be left with dangling pointers to freed memory. The next time it
looks up a string in the string table, all manner of grievous things could
happen. The string table is just special and we need special support for it.</p>
<p>In particular, it needs a special kind of reference. The table should be able
to have a reference to a string, but that reference should not be considered a
valid edge when determining reachability. That implies that the referred to
object can be freed. When that happens, the string table needs to be notified
somehow so that it can also clear out the dangling pointer.</p>
<p>This particular set of semantics for a reference comes up frequently enough
that it has a name: a <a href="ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_reference"><strong>weak reference.</strong></a> A weak reference does not
keep the referred-to object alive in memory. When the object is freed, the
reference itself is removed too. Sort of like a magic self-clearing pointer.</p>
<p>We have already implicitly implemented half of the string table&rsquo;s unique
behavior by virtue of the fact that we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> traverse it during marking. That
means it doesn&rsquo;t force strings to be reachable. The remaining piece is clearing
out any dangling pointers for strings that are freed:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>sweep</em>()</div>

<p>To remove references to unreachable strings, we need to know which strings <em>are</em>
unreachable. We don&rsquo;t know that until after the mark phase has completed. But
we can&rsquo;t wait until after the sweep phase is done because then the objects<span class="em">&mdash;</span>and their mark bits<span class="em">&mdash;</span>are no longer around to check. So the right time is
exactly between the marking and sweeping phases.</p>

<p>We walk every entry in the table. For the string table, we only use the key part
of the entry. We look at each key string. If the string object&rsquo;s mark bit is not
set, then it is a white object that is moments from being swept away. We delete
it from the hash table first and now we have ensured we won&rsquo;t see any dangling
pointers.</p>
<h2><a href="#garbage-collection-strategies" name="garbage-collection-strategies"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;6</small> Garbage Collection Strategies</a></h2>
<p>We have a fully functioning mark-sweep garbage collector now. When the stress
testing flag is enabled, it gets called all the time, and with the logging
enabled too we can watch it do its thing and see that it is indeed collecting.
But, when the stress testing flag is off, it never runs at all. It&rsquo;s time for
us to decide when the collector should be invoked during a normal program
execution.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this question is poorly answered by the literature. When
garbage collectors were first invented, computers had a tiny, fixed amount of
memory. Many of the early GC papers assume that you set aside a few thousand
words of memory<span class="em">&mdash;</span>in other words, most of it<span class="em">&mdash;</span>and run the collector any time
you run out. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>Modern machines have gigs of physical RAM, hidden behind the operating system&rsquo;s
even larger virtual memory abstraction, and is shared among a slew of other
programs all fighting for their chunk of memory. The operating system will let
your program request as much as it wants and then pages in and out from the disc
when physical memory gets full. You never really &ldquo;run out&rdquo; of memory, you just
get slower and slower.</p>
<h3><a href="#latency-and-throughput" name="latency-and-throughput"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;6&#8202;.&#8202;1</small> Latency and throughput</a></h3>
<p>It no longer makes sense to wait until you &ldquo;have to&rdquo;, to run the GC, so we need
a more subtle timing strategy. To reason about this more precisely, it&rsquo;s time
to introduce two fundamental numbers used when measuring a memory manager&rsquo;s
performance: <strong>throughput</strong> and <strong>latency</strong>.</p>
<p>A managed language, as the name implies, manage&rsquo;s the program&rsquo;s heap-allocated
memory on the user&rsquo;s behalf. Users don&rsquo;t have to explicitly free memory because
the VM does it for them. That management comes at a performance cost. The time
spent actually freeing memory is the same whether explicitly freed by the user
or by the memory manager.</p>
<p>But there is additional overhead the GC adds at runtime to figure out <em>which</em>
memory to free. That time spent finding memory to free is time <em>not</em> spent
running the user&rsquo;s code and doing useful work. In our implementation, that&rsquo;s the
entirety of the mark phase. The goal of a sophisticated garbage collector is to
minimize that overhead.</p>
<p>There are two key metrics we can use to understand that overhead better:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> is the total amount of time spent running user code versus
    doing garbage collection work. Say you run a clox program for ten seconds
    and it spends a second of that inside <code>collectGarbage()</code>. That means the
    throughput is 90%<span class="em">&mdash;</span>it spent 90% of the time running the program and 10%
    on GC overhead.</p>
<p>Throughput is the most fundamental measure because it tracks the total cost
of collection overhead. All else being equal, you want to maximize
throughput. Up until this chapter, clox had no GC at all and thus 100%
throughput. That&rsquo;s pretty hard to beat. Of course, it came at the slight
expense of potentially running out of memory and crashing if the user&rsquo;s
program ran long enough. You can look at the goal of a GC as fixing that
&ldquo;glitch&rdquo; while sacrificing as little throughput as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Latency</strong> is the longest <em>continuous</em> chunk of time where the user&rsquo;s
    program was completely paused while garbage collection was happening. It&rsquo;s
    a measure of how &ldquo;chunky&rdquo; the collector is. Latency is an entirely different
    metric than throughput. Imagine two runs of a clox program that both take
    ten seconds. In the first run, the GC kicks in once and spends a solid
    second in <code>collectGarbage()</code>. It does one big massive collection.</p>
<p>In the second run, the GC gets invoked five times, each for a fifth of a
second. The total amount of time spent collecting is still a second, so the
throughput is 90% in both cases. But in the second run, the latency is only
1/5th of a second, five times less than in the first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like analogies<span class="em">&mdash;</span>I do<span class="em">&mdash;</span>imagine that your program is a bakery selling
fresh-baked bread to customers. Throughput is the total number of loaves of
warm, crusty baguettes you can serve to customers in a single day. Latency is
the how long the unluckiest customer has to wait in line before they get served.</p>
<p>Running the garbage collector is like shutting down the bakery temporarily to go
through all of the dishes, sort out the dirty from the clean, and then wash the
used ones. In our analogy, we don&rsquo;t have <span
name="dishwasher">dedicated</span> dishwashers, so while this is going on, no
baking is happening. The bakers are all washing up.</p>
<aside name="dishwasher">
<p>If you consider each person in the analogy to represent a thread, then an
obvious optimization is to have separate threads running garbage collection,
giving you a <strong>concurrent garbage collector</strong>. In other words, hire some
dedicated dishwashers to wash while others keep baking. Indeed, this is how very
sophisticated GCs work, specifically because it does let the bakers<span class="em">&mdash;</span>the
worker threads<span class="em">&mdash;</span>keep running user code almost without interruption.</p>
<p>However, some coordination is required. The dishwashers and bakers do need to
put their hands on the same set of dishes. You don&rsquo;t want a dishwasher grabbing
a bowl out of a baker&rsquo;s hands! This coordination adds overhead and quite a lot
of complexity. Concurrent collectors are fast, but challenging to implement
correctly.</p>
</aside>
<p>Reducing the total number of loaves of bread you can sell in a day is bad, and
making any particular customer sit and wait while you clean all the dishes is
too. The goal is to maximize throughput and minimize latency, but there is no
free lunch, even inside a bakery. Garbage collectors make different trade-offs
between how much throughput they sacrifice and latency they tolerate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good because different user programs have different needs. An overnight
batch job that is generating a report from a terabyte of data just needs to get
as much work done as fast as possible. Throughput is queen. Meanwhile, an app
running on a user&rsquo;s smartphone needs to always respond immediately to user input
so that dragging on the screen feels <span name="butter">buttery</span> smooth.
The app can&rsquo;t freeze for a few seconds while the GC mucks around in the heap.</p>
<aside name="butter">
<p>Clearly the baking analogy is going to my head.</p>
<p><strong>TODO: overlap</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>When the garbage collector runs, it spends some amount of time for each live
object it finds, and some amount of time on each dead object that can be
reclaimed. In terms of our analogy, maybe you need to spend some time washing
the dishes that are dirty and a different amount of time putting setting trays
on racks when they still have dough on them.</p>
<p>As a garbage collector author, you control some of the trade-off between
throughput and latency by your choice of collection algorithm. A <strong>copying
collector</strong> spends almost no time collecting dead objects but does have to spend
time moving every live object it finds in memory. Meanwhile, our mark-sweep
collector only needs to briefly visit live objects but has to explicitly call
<code>free()</code> on each reclaimed ones.</p>
<p>But even within a single algorithm, we have a lot of control over <em>how
frequently</em> the collector runs. Our collector is a <span
name="incremental">&ldquo;stop-the-world&rdquo;</span> GC which means the user&rsquo;s program is
paused until the entire garbage collection process has completed. If we wait a
long time before we run the collector, then a large number of dead objects
will accumulate. That leads to a very long pause while the collector runs and
thus high latency.</p>
<aside name="incremental">
<p>An <strong>incremental garbage collector</strong> can do a little collection, then run some
user code, then collect a little more, and so on.</p>
</aside>
<p>So, obviously, we want to run the collector really frequently. But every time
the collector runs, it spends some time visiting live objects. That doesn&rsquo;t
really <em>do</em> anything useful (aside from ensuring that they don&rsquo;t incorrectly
get deleted). Time visiting live objects is time not freeing memory and also
time <em>not</em> running user code. If you run the GC <em>really</em> frequently, then the
user&rsquo;s program doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to even generate new garbage for it to
collect. The VM will spend all of its time obsessively revisiting the same set
of live objects over and over, and throughput suffers.</p>
<p>So, obviously, we want to run the collector really <em>in</em>-frequently. In fact, we
want something in the middle, and the frequency of when the collector runs is
one of the main knobs we have to tune the trade-off between latency and
throughput.</p>
<h3><a href="#self-adjusting-heap" name="self-adjusting-heap"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;6&#8202;.&#8202;2</small> Self-adjusting heap</a></h3>
<p>We want our GC to run frequently enough to reduce latency but infrequently
enough to maintain decent throughput. But how do we find the balance between
these when we have no idea how much memory the user&rsquo;s program needs and how
often it allocates? We could pawn the problem onto the user and force them to
pick by exposing GC tuning parameters. Many VMs do this. But if we, the GC
authors, don&rsquo;t know how to tune it well, odds are good most users won&rsquo;t either.
We want to have at least a pretty reasonable default behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, this is not my area of expertise. I&rsquo;ve talked to a
number of professional GC hackers<span class="em">&mdash;</span>this is something you can build an entire
career on<span class="em">&mdash;</span>and read a lot of the literature, and all of the answers I got
were pretty hand-wavey. The strategy we&rsquo;re using here is common, pretty simple,
and (I hope!) good enough for most uses.</p>
<p>The idea is that the collector frequency automatically adjusts based on the size
of the heap. We&rsquo;ll keep track of the total number of bytes of managed memory
that the VM has allocated so far. When it goes above a threshold, we trigger a
GC. After that, we note how many bytes of memory remain<span class="em">&mdash;</span>how many were <em>not</em>
freed. Then we adjust the treshold to some value larger than that.</p>
<p>The result is that as the amount of live memory increases, we collect less
frequently in order to avoid sacrificing throughput by re-traversing the live
objects. As the amount of live memory goes down, we collect more frequently so
that we don&rsquo;t lose too much latency by waiting too long.</p>
<p>The implementation requies two new bookkeeping fields in the VM:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">ObjUpvalue</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">openUpvalues</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>vm.h</em><br>
in struct <em>VM</em></div>
<pre class="insert"><br><span></span>  <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">bytesAllocated</span><span class="p">;</span>   
  <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">nextGC</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>vm.h</em>, in struct <em>VM</em></div>

<p>The first is a running total of the number of bytes of managed memory the VM has
allocated. The second is the threshold that will trigger the next collection. We
initialize them when the VM starts up:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">objects</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">;</span>      
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>vm.c</em><br>

<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bytesAllocated</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>  
  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">nextGC</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1024</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span>  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">grayCount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>       
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>vm.c</em>, in <em>initVM</em>()</div>

<p>The starting threshold here is pretty <span name="lab">arbitrary</span>. It&rsquo;s
similar to the initial capacity we picked for our various dynamic arrays. The
goal is to not trigger the first few GCs <em>too</em> quickly but also to not wait too
long. We we had some real-world Lox programs, we could use those to profile and
tune this. But since all we have is toy programs, I just picked a number.</p>
<aside name="lab">
<p>A very common problem with getting experience with garbage collectors is that
it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> hard to discover the best practices in an isolated lab environment.
You don&rsquo;t see how a collector actually performs unless you run it on the kind of
large, messy real-world programs it is actually intended for. A GC tuned using
micro-benchmarks rarely performs well out in nature.</p>
</aside>
<p>Every time we allocate or free some memory, we adjust the counter:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="nf">reallocate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">previous</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">oldSize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">size_t</span> <span class="n">newSize</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>If the total crosses the limit, we run the collector:</p>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>reallocate</em>()</div>

<p>Now, finally, our garbage collector will actually do something when the user
runs a program without our hidden diagnostic flag enabled. When the sweep phase
frees objects, that also goes through <code>reallocate()</code>, lowering the value of
<code>bytesAllocated</code>, so after that completes we know how many live bytes are
remaining. We adjust the next threshold based on that:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">sweep</span><span class="p">();</span>

<pre class="insert"><br><span></span>  <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">nextGC</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bytesAllocated</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">GC_HEAP_GROW_FACTOR</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>memory.c</em>, in <em>collectGarbage</em>()</div>

<p>The threshold is a multiple of the heap size. This way, as the amount of memory
the program uses grows, the threshold moves farther out to ensure we don&rsquo;t
thrash the GC more and more. like other numbers in this chapter, the scaling
factor is basically arbitrary:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#endif                                                            </span>

<p>You&rsquo;d want to tune this in your implementation once you had some real programs
to benchmark it on. What we can do now is at least <em>log</em> some of the statistics
that we have. We capture the heap size before the collection:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;-- gc begin</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>This way we can see how much the garbage collector accomplished while it ran.</p>
<h2><a href="#garbage-collection-bugs" name="garbage-collection-bugs"><small>26&#8202;.&#8202;7</small> Garbage Collection Bugs</a></h2>
<p>In theory, we are all done now. We have a GC. It kicks in periodically, collects
what it can, and leaves the rest. If this were a typical textbook, we would wipe
the dust from our hands and bask in the soft glow of the flawless marble edifice
we have created.</p>
<p>Alas, I aim to teach you not just the theory of programming languages but the
sometimes painful reality. I am going to roll over a rotten log and show you
some of the nasty bugs that live under, and garbage collector bugs really are
some of the grossest invertebrates out there.</p>
<p>The collector frees any object it can find if it thinks the object is not being
used. It is our task to ensure that the garbage collector can find every object
it should free. Also, we must take pains to ensure that the GC knows which
objects <em>may</em> be used. If we forget to tell it that some object is reachable and
the collector frees it, no one is going to be happy when the VM tries to access
that later.</p>
<p>In both cases, mistakes are easy to make and not quickly obvious. Slow memory
leaks and memory accesses that still <em>look</em> right even though the memory is
technically no longer ours can let the VM keep running well past the point that
the erroneous code has executed.</p>
<p>This is made even harder by the fact that we don&rsquo;t know when the collector will
run. Any call that eventually allocates some memory is a place in the VM where a
collection could happen. It&rsquo;s like musical chairs. At any point, the GC might
stop the music. Every single heap allocated object that we want to use in the
future needs to find a chair quickly<span class="em">&mdash;</span>get marked as a root or stored as a
reference in some other object<span class="em">&mdash;</span>before the sweep phase comes to kick it out of
the game.</p>
<p>How could the VM use an object that the GC doesn&rsquo;t see as root? If the GC can&rsquo;t
find it, how can the VM? The most common answer is that a pointer to the object
is stored in some local variable on the C stack. The GC walk&rsquo;s the <em>VM</em>&lsquo;s value
and CallFrame stacks, but the C stack is <span name="c">hidden</span> to it.</p>
<aside name="c">
<p>Our GC can&rsquo;t find addresses in the C stack, but some can. <strong>Conservative</strong>
garbage collectors look all through memory, include the native stack and
consider any series of bytes that looks like it <em>could</em> be an address (which is
why they are called &ldquo;conservative&rdquo;) to be one. The most well-known of this
variety is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehm_garbage_collector">Boehm–Demers–Weiser garbage collector</a>, usually just
called the &ldquo;Boehm collector&rdquo;. (The best way to fame in CS is a last name that&rsquo;s
alphabetically early so that it shows up first in sorted lists of names.)</p>
</aside>
<p>In several previous chapters, we wrote seemingly pointless code that pushed an
object onto the VM&rsquo;s value stack, did a little work, and then popped it right
back off. Most times, I said this was for the GC&rsquo;s benefit. Now you see why.
That chunk of work it did between pushing and popping was code that potentially
allocated memory and thus could trigger a GC. We had to make sure the object was
on the value stack so that the collector&rsquo;s mark phase would find it and keep it
alive.</p>
<p>I wrote the entire clox implementation before splitting it into chapters and
writing the prose, so I had plenty of time to find all of these corners and
flush out most of these bugs. The stress testing code we put in at the beginning
of this chapter and a pretty good test suite were very helpful.</p>
<p>But I only fixed <em>most</em> of them. I left a couple in because I want to give you a
hint of what it&rsquo;s like to encounter these bugs in the wild. If you keep the
stress test flag enabled and running some toy Lox programs, you can probably
stumble onto a few on your own. Give it a try and then I&rsquo;ll walk you through
them.</p>
<p>The first you are very likely to hit on your own. The constant table each chunk
owns is a dynamic array. When the compiler adds a new constant to the current
function&rsquo;s table, that array may need to grow. The constant itself may also be
some heap-allocated object like a string or a nested function.</p>
<p>The new object being added to the constant table is passed to <code>addConstant()</code>.
At that moment, the object can only be found in the parameter to that function
on the C stack. That function appends the object to the constant table. If the
table doesn&rsquo;t have enough capacity and needs to grow, it calls <code>reallocate()</code>.
That in turn triggers a GC, which fails to mark the new constant object and
thus sweeps it right before we have a chance to add it to the table. Crash.</p>
<p>The first, as you&rsquo;ve seen in other places, is to push it onto the stack
temporarily:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">addConstant</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Chunk</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">chunk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Value</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>chunk.c</em><br>
in <em>addConstant</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span>                              
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span>  <span class="n">writeValueArray</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">chunk</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">constants</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>chunk.c</em>, in <em>addConstant</em>()</div>

<p>Once the constant table also has a reference to the object, it is safely
reachable and we can pop it off the stack:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">writeValueArray</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">chunk</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">constants</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>chunk.c</em><br>
in <em>addConstant</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>                                    
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">chunk</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">constants</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>        
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>chunk.c</em>, in <em>addConstant</em>()</div>

<p>When the GC is marking roots, it walks the chain of compilers and marks each of
their functions, so the new constant is reachable now. We do need an include
to call into the VM from the &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; module:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;value.h&quot;            </span><span class="cp"></span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>chunk.c</em></div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&quot;vm.h&quot;               </span><span class="cp"></span>
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">initChunk</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Chunk</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">chunk</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>chunk.c</em></div>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another similar one. All strings are interned in clox so whenever we
create a new string we also add it to the intern table. You can see where this
is going. Since the string is brand new, it isn&rsquo;t reachable anywhere. And
resizing the string pool can trigger a collection. Again, we go ahead and stash
the string on the stack first:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">string</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hash</span><span class="p">;</span>                   
<br></pre><div class="source-file"><em>object.c</em><br>
in <em>allocateString</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OBJ_VAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="p">));</span>                 
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span>  <span class="n">tableSet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">strings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NIL_VAL</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>object.c</em>, in <em>allocateString</em>()</div>

<p>And then pop it back off once it&rsquo;s safely nestled in the table:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">tableSet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">strings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NIL_VAL</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>object.c</em><br>
in <em>allocateString</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>                                 
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">;</span>                         
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>object.c</em>, in <em>allocateString</em>()</div>

<p>Remember, the table only stores <em>weak</em> references to objects, so this won&rsquo;t
actually prevent the string from being freed. But that&rsquo;s OK. We just need to
ensure the string is safe while the table is being resized. Once it survives
that, <code>allocateString()</code> will return it to some caller which can then take
responsibility for ensuring the string is still reachable before the next heap
allocation occurs.</p>
<p>One last example. Over in the interpreter, the <code>OP_ADD</code> instruction can be used
to concatenate two strings. As it does with numbers, it pops the two operands
from the stack, computes the result, and pushes that new value back onto the
stack. For numbers that&rsquo;s perfectly safe.</p>
<p>But concatenating two strings requires allocating a new character array on the
heap, which can in turn trigger a GC. Since we&rsquo;ve already popped the operands
by that point, they can potentially be missed by the mark phase and get swept
away. Instead of popping them off the stack eagerly, we will <em>peek</em> them:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span><span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">concatenate</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>          
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>vm.c</em><br>
in <em>concatenate</em>()<br>
replace 2 lines</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">ObjString</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">AS_STRING</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">peek</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">));</span> 
  <span class="n">ObjString</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">AS_STRING</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">peek</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">));</span> 
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><br><span></span>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>vm.c</em>, in <em>concatenate</em>(), replace 2 lines</div>

<p>That way, they are still hanging out on the stack when we create the result
string. Once that&rsquo;s done, we can safely pop them off and replace them with the
result:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre class="insert-before"><span></span>  <span class="n">ObjString</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">takeString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">chars</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre><div class="source-file"><em>vm.c</em><br>
in <em>concatenate</em>()</div>
<pre class="insert"><span></span>  <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>                                        
  <span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">();</span>                                        
</pre><pre class="insert-after"><span></span>  <span class="n">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OBJ_VAL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">result</span><span class="p">));</span>                        
</pre></div>

<div class="source-file-narrow"><em>vm.c</em>, in <em>concatenate</em>()</div>

<p>Those were all pretty easy, especially because I <em>showed</em> you were the fix was.
In practice, <em>finding</em> them is the hard part. All you see is an object that
<em>should</em> be there but isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not like other bugs where you&rsquo;re looking for
the code that <em>causes</em> some problem. You&rsquo;re looking for the <em>absence</em> of code
which fails to <em>prevent</em> a problem, and that&rsquo;s a much harder search.</p>
<p>But, for now at least, you can rest easy. As far as I know, we&rsquo;ve found all of
the collection bugs in clox and now we have a working, robust, self-tuning
mark-sweep garbage collector.</p>
<div class="challenges">
<h2><a href="#challenges" name="challenges">Challenges</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The Obj header struct at the top of each object now has three fields:
    <code>type</code>, <code>isMarked</code>, and <code>next</code>. How much memory do those take up (on your
    machine)? Can you come up with something more compact? Is there a runtime
    cost to doing so?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the sweep phase traverses a live object, it clears the <code>isMarked</code>
    field to prepare it for the next collection cycle. Can you come up with a
    more efficient approach?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark-sweep is only one of a variety of garbage collection algorithms out
    there. Explore those by replacing or augmenting the current collector with
    another one. Good candidates to consider are reference counting, Cheney&rsquo;s
    algorithm, or the Lisp 2 mark-compact algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="design-note">
<h2><a href="#design-note" name="design-note">Design Note: Generational Collectors
</a></h2>

<p>A key challenge with how frequently you run the collector is that the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
answer depends a lot on how much garbage you have and how many objects survive.
If most objects are still alive, you don&rsquo;t want to spend a ton of time
revisiting them over and over again. But when a program is churning through
temporary objects, you want to collect frequently to keep pauses short and avoid
a big backlog of dead bytes.</p>
<p>If only there were some way to tell when or which objects were likely to be
long-lived and which weren&rsquo;t. Well, spoiler alert, there kind of is. Many years
ago, GC researchers gathered some metrics on the lifetime of objects in
real-world running programs. They tracked every object when it was allocated
and eventually when it was no longer needed and then graphed out how long
objects tended to live.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>todo: draw bathtub curve</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>They discovered something they called the <strong>generational hypothesis</strong>, or the
much less pleasant term <strong>infant mortality</strong>. Their observation was that most
objects are very short-lived but once they survive beyond a certain age, they
tend to stick around quite a long time. This observation is powerful because it
gave them a handle on how to partition objects into groups that benefit from
frequent collections and those that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They did this by tracking how old objects are using a system called
<strong>generational garbage collection</strong>. It works like this. Every time a new object
is allocated, it goes into a special relatively small region of the heap called
the <em>nursery</em>. Since objects tend to die young, the garbage collector is invoked
pretty <span name="nursery">frequently</span> over the objects just in this
region.</p>
<aside name="nursery">
<p>Also, nurseries are usually managed using a copying collector which is faster at
allocating and freeing objects than a mark-sweep collector.</p>
</aside>
<p>Each time the GC runs over the nursery is called a <em>generation</em>. Any objects
that are no longer needed get freed. Those that survive are now considered one
generation older, and the GC tracks this for each object. If an object survives
a certain number of generations<span class="em">&mdash;</span>often just a single collection<span class="em">&mdash;</span>it gets
<em>tenured</em>. At this point, it is copied out of the nursery into a much larger
heap region for long-lived objects. The garbage collector runs over that region
too, but much less frequently since odds are good that most of those objects
will still be alive.</p>
<p>I love generation collectors because it&rsquo;s this beautiful marriage of empirical
data<span class="em">&mdash;</span>the observation that object lifetimes are <em>not</em> evenly distributed<span class="em">&mdash;</span>and an algorithm that can take advantage of that fact. It&rsquo;s also conceptually
quite simple. You can think of it as just two separately tuned GCs and a pretty
simple policy for moving objects from one to the other.</p>
