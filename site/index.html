<blockquote>A handbook for making programming languages.</blockquote>

<p>This book contains everything you need to implement a full-featured,
efficient scripting language. You&#8217;ll learn both high-level concepts around
parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and
garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will
get dirty and calloused. It&#8217;s a blast.</p>

<p>Starting from <code>main()</code>, you build a language that features rich
syntax, dynamic typing, garbage collection, lexical scope, first-class
functions, closures, classes, and inheritance. All packed into a few thousand
lines of clean, fast code that you thoroughly understand because you write each
one yourself.</p>

<p>And you can read the whole book, for free, online:</p>

<h2>I Want to Hold the Book in My Hands</h2>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but the word &ldquo;book&rdquo; to me still implies
ink and flattened rectangles of wood pulp. This book is not quite there yet. The
chapters are written, but I am still designing the print edition. If you want to
know when that&#8217;s ready, have I got the mailing list for you:</p>

<h2>Who Are You?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m Bob Nystrom. I got bitten by the language bug ten years ago when
I was on paternity leave with a lot of free time between middle of the night
feedings. Since then, I've cobbled together a <a href="http://wren.io/"
target="_blank">number</a> <a href="http://magpie-lang.org/"
target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/"
target="_blank">languages</a> <a href="https://github.com/munificent/vigil"
target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/munificent/jasic"
target="_blank">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/munificent/lark"
target="_blank">ilk</a> before worming my way into an honest-to-God full-time
programming language job. Today, I work at Google on the
<a href="http://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart language</a>.</p>

<p>Before I fell in love with languages, I developed games at Electronic Arts
for eight years. I wrote the best-selling book &ldquo;<a
href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/" target="_blank">Game Programming
Patterns</a>&rdquo; based on what I learned there. You can read that book for
free too, because I love you.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, you can email me at <code>bob</code> at this
site's domain or ask me (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob"
target="_blank"><code>@munificentbob</code></a>) on twitter. If you can&#8217;t
get enough of my writing, I also have <a
href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/" target="_blank">a blog</a>. If you
like the book, you&#8217;ll probably like it too.</p>
